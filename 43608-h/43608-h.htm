<p class="center chap">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> History of the Arctic Expedition of 1875-76, and
the record of its results, will be found in the work of
Sir George Nares. My object in publishing the
present volume is to furnish a popular narrative of
memorable events as they presented themselves to an
individual member of the Expedition, and especially
of the work of sledge travelling over the frozen polar
ocean. It was written a few months after our return
to England, but its appearance has been purposely
deferred until the publication of the work by Sir
George Nares.</p>

<p>The same reasons still exist for continuing the work
of Arctic exploration as were adduced for commencing
it in 1875.</p>

<p>It is impossible to complete so great a work in one
campaign, and the results of the late Expedition
ought only to whet our appetites, and stimulate us to
undertake further discoveries.</p>

<p>The narrative of Sir George Nares will show the
completeness of the work accomplished, so far as the
route by Smith Sound is concerned, and with the
appendices containing the numerous and valuable
scientific results, will prove the importance of Arctic
discovery. But there are other routes remaining to
be explored, which will yield equally useful results.</p>

<p>Behring Strait is a portal leading to a vast region,
the history of which has hitherto been as a sealed
book.</p>

<p>An expedition to the east coast of Greenland for
the purpose of connecting our discoveries at Cape
Britannia with those of the Germans at Cape
Bismarck, and thus solving the interesting geographical
problem regarding the insularity of Greenland,
would be of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>The exploration of Jones and Hayes Sounds offer
a rich field; but that which, in my opinion, would
yield the most profitable harvest, is the continuation
of the discoveries of the Austro-Hungarian expedition
in Franz-Josef Land. Once reach in a ship the
position attained by Lieut. Payer and his sledge
party, and such a measure of success would follow as
would prove satisfactory even to the most sanguine.
Although the flags of Holland, Sweden, and America
will this year float in the Arctic Regions, that of
England will be unrepresented.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be expected, in the present critical
state of affairs, that our Government can afford to
give either time or attention to the subject of Arctic
exploration, but when the existing differences are all
happily settled, there will really be more reasons for
following up the work than were brought forward for
undertaking it in 1875. We were never in a better
position for doing so than at the present time. We
possess a couple of ships whose capabilities for Arctic
navigation have been already thoroughly tested, and
found perfect; we have officers and men experienced
in the navigation of those icy seas and in sledging,
and we have stores and provisions ready to equip
another expedition.</p>

<p>The expense, seeing that the ships and stores are
lying idle, would be insignificant, and would hardly
be more than equal to that of keeping a couple of
small gun-boats in commission. Surely this great
nation could easily afford, in the interests of science
and for her own honour, to incur such an expenditure.
I trust so; and I, for one, look forward with confident
hope to the despatch, in a few years, of another Arctic
expedition as well equipped as the one of which I was
lately a member.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> above quaint lines, written five hundred years
ago, well describe the scenes that were being enacted
during the months of April and May, 1875, in
Portsmouth Dockyard.</p>

<p>Busy as this great naval depôt of England almost
always is, it is seldom, in peace time, that so much
interest is shown in the equipment of two small
steam-vessels as was the case with regard to those
that were then lying &ldquo;all a taunto&rdquo; in the steam
basin of that extensive yard.</p>

<p>The names of those comparatively small ships were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>
the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; their destination
the unknown North.</p>

<p>Although of insignificant size, in comparison with
the huge ironclad monsters by which they were
surrounded, yet a close observer would readily detect
signs of great strength in these two business-like
looking vessels. And very necessary was it that they
should possess strength and powers of resistance of no
ordinary kind, for they were destined to grapple and
fight with the heavy and unyielding ice floes of the
Polar Ocean.</p>

<p>The two ships had been very carefully selected and
fitted for the important work in which they were
about to engage. The &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; was a 17-gun sloop,
and had already served two or three commissions on
foreign stations before she was converted for Arctic
service. The &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; was built in Dundee for
the whaling and sealing trade, in which she had been
engaged for a short time off the coast of Newfoundland,
before she was purchased for the Arctic expedition.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; was thoroughly strengthened, and,
under the supervision of the Admiral Superintendent
of the Dockyard (Sir Leopold McClintock), adapted in
every way for the hazardous service on which she was
about to be employed.</p>

<p>After a complete overhaul of her hull, all defective
timbers and beams were removed, and replaced by
sound ones; extra beam power was introduced; an
external sheathing of seven inches of teak, tapering
from amidships to four inches forward and three
inches aft, extending from the keel to the waterways,
was put on; whilst a longitudinal beam, placed
between the shelf-piece and the lower-deck waterway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span>
internally, bound and strapped the whole ship
together. Extra iron knees were introduced in order
more effectually to resist the enormous pressure of
the ice; and the stem was fortified outside with half-inch
iron plates extending to about ten or twelve feet
aft, whilst inside the bow was strengthened by
numerous diagonal beams and dead-wood.</p>

<p>Between the inside planking and the lining were
placed sheets of felt for the promotion of warmth.
New waterways, of a most substantial form, were
added; and the ship was divided into watertight
compartments.</p>

<p>Two large davits projected over each quarter of the
vessel, by the aid of which the rudder, some three
tons weight, was easily shipped and unshipped when
in danger of being damaged by the ice. On these
occasions it would be suspended horizontally over the
stern from the davits.</p>

<p>Around the galley-funnel was an ingenious contrivance
for making water, consisting of a large
reservoir to receive either snow or ice; this, being
dissolved by the heat from the fire underneath, is
drawn off through a tap at the bottom, thus providing
our water supply. Like all vessels employed in the
whaling trade, both ships were fitted with Pinkey and
Collins&rsquo; patent reefing and furling topsails; and each
possessed a steam-winch on the upper deck, capable
of being utilized for many purposes.</p>

<p>At the maintop-gallant-mast-head of each vessel
was a large barrel-like object. This was the crow&rsquo;s
nest, a very necessary item on board all ships destined
to navigate the icy seas. Both ships were barque-rigged,
and were supplied with the ordinary contrivances
used on board short-handed merchant
vessels to facilitate the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span></p>

<p>They formed, indeed, a curious contrast to the
heavily rigged but trim men-of-war, which, with their
tapering spars and faultlessly squared yards, lay in
the harbour near them.</p>

<p>Each vessel was supplied with nine boats of various
shapes and sizes, specially designed and constructed
for the service peculiar to Arctic waters. Two of
these were completely equipped for whaling, so as to
be able to follow and capture walruses and narwhals.
They were both fitted with harpoon-guns fixed on
swivels in the bows. The ice-boats were three in
number for each ship, and were built as light as it
was possible to make them. Paddles were supplied,
by which they could be propelled, as well as oars.
They were all carvel-built boats, and the bows of each
were armed with a broad sheet of copper as a protection
from the ice.</p>

<p>The figure-heads of each ship, like their fittings,
were exactly similar. They were what are commonly
called &ldquo;fiddle-heads,&rdquo; having the Union Jack painted
on them, and underneath the word <i>Ubique</i>; and to
no flag can that word be more truly and more
appropriately applied. <i>Everywhere</i> is it to be found,
even beyond the limits of the abode of man!</p>

<p>The clothing and provisions supplied to the ships
were in a great measure regulated according to the
establishments by which preceding expeditions had
been fitted out, and were almost identical in texture
and quality.</p>

<p>Great care was taken in the selection of both
officers and men, and none were appointed until they
had undergone a searching medical examination as
to their fitness for Arctic service, several being rejected
who had the appearance of being fine and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span>
eligible young fellows. The slightest defect, such as
bad teeth or old wounds, was a sufficient pretext for
refusing the services of otherwise apparently strong
and healthy men. Numerous were the volunteers
that came forward, rendering the task of selecting
a few from the number of eager willing men that
presented themselves one of no little difficulty.</p>

<p>Their social and moral qualifications were as
strictly inquired into as was their physical condition;
and men of a happy and genial disposition
were selected in preference to others who appeared
morose and taciturn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you sing or dance? or what can you do for
the amusement of others?&rdquo; were questions invariably
addressed to candidates for Arctic service by the
board of officers appointed to select from the numerous
applicants who presented themselves.</p>

<p>The ray of pleasure that lighted up the faces of
those individuals who were informed that they were
to be of that small chosen band, indicated most
clearly the popularity of the enterprize amongst
the men of the Royal Navy; whilst the disappointed
ones, and they were many, showed only too plainly
the mortification they experienced at being rejected.
As an instance of the eagerness evinced by the men
to be employed in the expedition, a gallant captain
commanding a ship at Portsmouth called at the
office where the men were being entered, and requested
advice. He said, &ldquo;An order has come on
board my ship, directing me to send volunteers for
Arctic service to this office. What am I to do?
The whole ship&rsquo;s company, nearly eight hundred
men, have given in their names!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is merely mentioned in order to show the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>
amount of interest taken by the whole navy in
the cause for which the ships were being equipped.</p>

<p>The ships&rsquo; companies being completed, officers and
men were unremittingly engaged in the various duties
incidental to fitting out. Provisions and stores, sufficient
to last for three years, had to be received on
board and stowed away. There was no waste space
on board either vessel. Every little nook and corner
was destined to be the receptacle of some important
article. The ships gradually settled down in the
water as the weights on board accumulated, until they
appeared to be alarmingly deep, whilst much yet
remained unstowed. The Admiralty had, however,
provided for this emergency. The &ldquo;Valorous,&rdquo; an old
paddle-wheel sloop of good carrying capabilities, was
ordered to convey all surplus stores, that could not
be stowed on board the two exploring vessels, as
far as the island of Disco, on the west coast of
Greenland.</p>

<p>This was a very wise and necessary precaution, as
it would be obviously unsafe to cross the Atlantic
in boisterous weather, laden as the two ships undoubtedly
would have been if they had received no
assistance from a third vessel in the conveyance of
their stores.</p>

<p>Through the kindness and generosity of our friends,
and of those who more especially interested themselves
in the progress of Arctic discovery, we received
many useful and valuable gifts. Her Majesty and
the members of the Royal Family testified, in a
substantial manner, the deep interest they took in
the enterprize. The name of her Imperial Majesty
the Empress Eugénie must always be associated
with the expedition as one of its warmest friends.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>7</span>
Her kind and considerate present, consisting of a fine
woollen cap for each individual, contributed materially
to our comfort whilst engaged in the onerous duties of
sledging.</p>

<p>To mention the names of all our generous benefactors
would require a chapter to itself. Books,
magic lanterns, a piano, pictures, and money came
pouring in from all sides; but smaller and less
valuable, though not the less appreciated, gifts were
also received. A small case, with the superscription,
&ldquo;A Christmas box for my friends on board the
&lsquo;Alert,&rsquo;&rdquo; and containing four bottles of excellent
punch, and a little parcel of well-thumbed books and
periodicals, showing undoubted signs of having been
well perused, but which came with the &ldquo;best wishes
of a warrant officer, himself an old Arctic explorer,&rdquo;
were accepted with as much pleasure and gratitude
as were the more costly presents.</p>

<p>Games of all descriptions, to while away the long
evenings of a dark and monotonous winter, were
purchased; whilst a complete set of instruments for
a drum-and-fife band was also added to the long list
of our necessaries.</p>

<p>In devoting a certain sum of money to the purchase
of musical instruments and games, wherewithal to
amuse ourselves, we were only following an example
set us many years ago; for when Sir Humphrey
Gilbert sailed in 1583, for the purpose of discovering
new lands, and planting Christian colonies upon
those large and ample countries extending northward
from Florida, we read that, &ldquo;for the solace of our
people, and allurement of the savages, we were provided
of musicke in good varietie; not omitting the
least toyes, as morris dancers, hobby horses, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
many like conceits, to delight the savage people,
whom we intended to winne by all faire meanes possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We also hear, when that brave old navigator
John Davis undertook his first voyage in 1585, with
his two frail little barks, the &ldquo;Sunneshine&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Mooneshine,&rdquo; that in the first-named vessel were
twenty-three persons, of whom four were musicians&mdash;a
large band in proportion to the complement of
officers and men.</p>

<p>In spite of the bustle and confusion that are inseparable
from the preparation of such an expedition,
in spite of fresh paint and tarry ropes, several
thousands of visitors came on board before sailing,
to the no small hindrance of the work; but it is
feared that many others, owing to the stringent
regulations that it was necessary to issue in order
to have the vessels ready by the appointed time,
were compelled to return to their homes without
having the satisfaction of saying that they had been
on board the Polar ships. Amongst those who
honoured the vessels with a visit were his Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales, his Royal Highness
the Duke of Edinburgh, and her Imperial Majesty the
Empress Eugénie.</p>

<p>The entertainments given in our honour were very
numerous; many were almost regarded as <i>farewell</i>
banquets.</p>

<p>We were looked upon as public property; our
hospitable countrymen, in the generosity of their
hearts, never thinking that we should like to spend our
last few days in England in peace and quietness
amongst our own friends, wished to feed us on the
fat of the land, and send us to sea suffering from that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
worst of all complaints, dyspepsia, accompanied
perhaps by <i>mal de mer</i>.</p>

<p>At length all preparations were completed. The
day originally assigned for the sailing of the expedition,
the 29th of May, dawned grey and misty,
with dashes of rain falling and lying in little pools on
our freshly painted deck. During the forenoon we
were honoured by a visit from the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, who came to bid us farewell and
success on our mission. This was the last official
visit paid to the vessels. At its termination officers
and men were left pretty much to themselves, so that
their last few hours in England might be spent with
their own relatives. Four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon
was the hour named for the departure of the ships,
and punctual to the very minute they cast off from
the dockyard jetty. The last embrace had been
taken, the last fervent farewell had been wished, and,
a good omen for the coming voyage, as the vessels
steamed out of Portsmouth Harbour, all clouds
cleared away, and the sun shone out bright and
joyous. During the day crowds had been flocking from
all parts of England in order to add their voices to
those of other well-wishers to the enterprize. Seldom
before in that famous seaport town, although the
centre of many stirring events, had such a scene been
witnessed. Thousands of spectators were congregated
along the sea-face extending from the dockyard to
Southsea Castle, and on the opposite shore of Gosport,
to witness our departure; and cheer after cheer
pealed forth from the assembled multitude as we
slowly threaded our way amongst the numerous yachts
and pleasure boats that had collected to bid us Godspeed.
A small thin line of red, hardly to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
distinguished amidst the more sombre hue of the
holiday seekers&rsquo; dresses, denoted the troops of the
garrison drawn up to do honour to their comrades of
the sister service, whilst their bands, breaking forth
with the soul-stirring strains of &ldquo;Auld lang syne,&rdquo;
found an echo in the hearts of all connected with the
expedition.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a proud moment for us as we
witnessed this unmistakeable demonstration, and felt
that we, a small but chosen band, had been selected
to carry out a national enterprize of such importance.</p>

<p>If anything was required to assure us of the
popularity of our undertaking, the spectacle that
afternoon on Southsea Common was surely a convincing
proof.</p>

<p>There was but one responsive feeling in the hearts
of every member of the expedition, namely, a determination
to deserve this confidence, and to achieve,
with God&rsquo;s help, such a measure of success as would
prove satisfactory to the country and creditable to
the navy.</p>

<p>It will be long before that scene is effaced from our
memories. Our last view of Portsmouth was across
a bright blue sea to a shore thronged with an
enthusiastic and cheering crowd waving a last
farewell; whilst the last glimpse our friends had of
us was across the same blue sparkling sea, the snow-white
sails of our ships being lit up by the rays of the
setting sun.</p>

<p>Our feelings appeared to be reflected in the changes
of the weather on that, to us, memorable day. The
rain and mist in the morning were emblematical of
the sorrow of parting; while when the sun burst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
forth bright and joyous in the afternoon, we all felt
assured that the work on which we were about to be
employed would be achieved, and that the enterprize
commenced under such bright auspices would terminate
as well and happily.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred to mar the departure; one
incident only happened that might have terminated
disastrously and thrown a gloom over the little
squadron. Immediately after the pilot had been
discharged, one of the men of the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; in the
excitement and ardour of responding to the cheers
with which we were on all sides greeted, lost his
balance in the rigging and fell overboard. He was,
however, quickly picked up and brought on board
none the worse for his immersion, although the
consternation excited by this mishap to a boatload of
men and women, who happened to witness the
accident, nearly resulted in fatal consequences. The
half-drowned and thoroughly drenched man being
restored to his shipmates, the squadron having been
joined at Spithead by the &ldquo;Valorous,&rdquo; rounded the
Nab-light vessel, and before a fine fresh north-easterly
breeze spread their sails and steered down channel.</p>

<p>For many hours, however, they were escorted by
a little yacht containing the relatives of some few
of the officers of the expedition, which following in
their wake reluctantly parted only when all further
communication was impracticable.</p>

<p>This, and a visit we received on the following
morning from the brave old admiral, the Commander-in-chief
at Plymouth, when passing the port, was the
last sight of friends we were destined to enjoy for
many a long month.</p>

<p>We all felt that we had bidden them a long farewell,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
and from thenceforth, as far as they were concerned,
we could only live in the happy memories of the
past, buoyed up by hopes and aspirations as to the
future.</p>

<p>Experiencing fine weather, the anchors were
dropped on the third day in the snug little harbour
of Berehaven, in Bantry Bay. The object of this
visit was to obtain our last supply of fresh meat,
and our last budget of letters from home. A farewell
ramble on shore amongst green fields and picturesque
little farmhouses, where we were regaled with delicious
fresh milk, was also enjoyed, and a visit paid
to some Druidical remains near the long straggling
village of Castletown.</p>

<p>And here, amongst the long green grass and by the
side of clear rippling rivulets, we gathered the last
flowers of spring that would gladden our eyes until
after our return to our native shore. Carefully were
these floral treasures hoarded until an opportunity
offered of transmitting them to dear friends at home.
It is related of one officer, who was so fortunate as to
gather several sprigs of &ldquo;forget-me-not,&rdquo; and whose
home ties were, perhaps, not so attractive as those of
others, that he offered to barter small tufts of this
precious little plant for a bottle of beer, or a pot of
cocoa and milk, the two latter articles being excessively
scarce on board the Arctic ships, and proportionately
valuable.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of June, the day following their arrival,
the little squadron once more put to sea. From that
date the receipt of all letters ceased. No more
telegrams; no loving missives; all intelligence from
home must come to an end. We could live only for
the future, and pray for a happy and speedy return.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
Before nightfall the high and rugged coast of Ireland
had sunk below the eastern horizon, leaving nothing
visible on the apparently boundless ocean but our
three ships as they were lazily rocked by the long
rolling swell of the broad Atlantic.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> next morning we found that on leaving England
we had also left behind bright sunshine and blue
skies, and in their place gloomy grey clouds were
spread over us, while rain fell sullenly through the
murky air. This, with head winds, was our normal
condition for many days. Steam was occasionally
raised during any lengthened periods of calm; but
the report from the engineer that steam was ready
was, as a rule, followed by a report from deck that
a breeze was springing up, but invariably from an
adverse quarter.</p>

discovered the good qualities of our ship&rsquo;s company.
There was a willingness about them that could not
fail to be appreciated, whilst the thorough good
feeling that seemed to exist was highly satisfactory.
As a proof of the desire of each one to assist his
neighbour, it may not be out of place to mention that
the petty officers of the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; a day or two after
leaving harbour, requested permission to take turns
with the able seamen in steering the ship, a duty from
which, by their position, they are usually exempt.
It need hardly be said their wish was immediately
gratified.</p>

<p>During the passage our medical staff was busily
engaged in ascertaining the physical capacities of
every individual member of the expedition. These
experiments were by some jokingly resented as an
unauthorized system of mental and bodily torture.
Every one&rsquo;s age was carefully noted; height and
weight accurately ascertained; dimensions round the
chest measured; and by means of an instrument
called a spirometer the capacity of the chest was also
obtained; a clinical thermometer was inserted into
the mouth and kept there for an apparently interminable
time for the purpose of ascertaining the
temperature of the blood. The treatment we were
subjected to in the cause of science was thus described
by one whose acquaintance with the Royal Navy was
only of a few days&rsquo; standing: &ldquo;I was unceremoniously
laid hold of and measured, forced into a chair
and weighed, was compelled to answer the most
impertinent questions regarding my age and connections;
a horrid instrument was kept in my mouth
for an hour or more, and I was forced to blow into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
a machine until not a breath of wind was left in my
body!&rdquo; The results of all these experiments were
duly registered, the intention being to compare them
with a similar examination on the return of the
expedition, in order to ascertain the effects of an
Arctic life upon the physical development of our
bodies.</p>

<p>The appetites of the officers, rendered doubly keen
by the fresh sea air, were so inordinate as to cause
serious anxiety in the mind of our worthy caterer,
who was fearful that the allowance of provisions
would never last the specified time, at the rate they
were then being consumed.</p>

<p>From the fifth day after leaving port lime juice
was regularly issued to every officer and man in the
expedition. Being considered an indispensable antiscorbutic,
it was essential that precautions should
be adopted to ensure the certainty of each man drinking
it daily. It was therefore the practice to serve it
out on the quarter-deck every forenoon in the presence
of an officer. This was never omitted during the
whole period that our expedition was absent from
England. With one or two exceptions the lime juice
was drunk with pleasure by the men, and the exceptions
were gradually educated, by taking it in small
quantities, until their dislike was cured.</p>

<p>In consequence of the limited stowage capacity on
board, the officers were unable to provide themselves
with a large stock of beer. A considerable quantity
of wine and spirits, however, was laid in; but as an
anticipated absence of three years had to be provided
for, we were restricted to an allowance of two glasses
of sherry per diem, a glass of port or madeira once a
week, and a bottle of brandy or whiskey about every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>
fourteen or fifteen days. On birthdays or fête days
we were also indulged in a glass of port wine after
dinner.</p>

<p>Ten hogsheads of Allsopp&rsquo;s ale, brewed especially
for the Arctic Expedition, were provided by Government
and formed part of the ship&rsquo;s stores. It was
grand stuff&mdash;&ldquo;strong enough,&rdquo; as one of the men
observed, &ldquo;to make our hair curl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were not destined to enjoy fine weather long,
and our passage across the Atlantic was by no means
a pleasant or a comfortable one. Gale followed after
gale. If they had only blown from the right quarter
we should have been happy, but we had no such luck,
they were sure to come ahead!</p>

<p>What a lively ship was the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo;! making it
utterly impossible to keep anything in its place. It
was decidedly annoying, one day, when I entered my
cabin to find my nice smart crimson table-cloth
drenched with ink; but it was no use repining, and
I could only exclaim, with Lord Dorset&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Our paper, pens, and ink, and we,</p>
<p class="i05">Are tumbled up and down at sea.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>Liveliness was not her only peculiarity, she was
likewise excessively wet, and although battened down
carefully it was impossible to keep the water from
going below. To those who are uninitiated in nautical
terms it must be explained that &ldquo;battening down&rdquo;
means the careful closing and covering with a tarpaulin
of every skylight and hatchway, in order to
prevent the water from finding its way below. In
spite, however, of these precautions, it is excessively
difficult to keep the lower deck of a small ship dry
during heavy weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span></p>

<p>On the 13th it was blowing furiously with a terrific
sea, and we were compelled to &ldquo;lay-to&rdquo; under very
reduced canvas. During the night a large steamer,
supposed to be bound for Quebec, passed close to us,
so close indeed that we were compelled to burn blue
lights in order to denote our position, so as to avoid
collision.</p>

<p>On the same night a heavy sea struck us, and
washed away our starboard whale boat. Our consort
also suffered the same loss. Nearly all our fowls,
which were in hen-coops on the upper deck, were
drowned; only two escaping! Fresh meat being
scarce the manner of their death did not prevent
their appearance on our table for some days. This
gale had the effect of dispersing our little squadron,
nor did we again assemble together until our arrival
at Disco.</p>

<p>No sooner had we recovered from the effects of one
gale, than we were assailed by another. Our only
consolation was, the very poor one of trying to believe
that these storms would eventually be the means of
assisting us in our passage through Melville Bay, by
breaking up the ice and blowing it out of Davis
Straits!</p>

<p>The discomforts entailed by the perpetual bad
weather did not in any way check the ardour of some
of the officers in their praiseworthy endeavours to add
to the scientific collections of the expedition. It is
related, but I will not vouch for the authenticity of
the story, that on one occasion, when the ship was
labouring heavily, a huge sea washed on board, finding
its way down through the skylight into the ward-room,
where it splashed about from side to side with
every roll of the ship. An officer, a most zealous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
and enthusiastic collector in all branches of natural
history, being in bed at the time, thought that he
detected by the dim light of a lantern some interesting,
and perhaps unknown, specimens of zoology in
the water. His landing net was immediately called
into requisition, and, from his bed, he succeeded in
fishing up some of these supposed wonderful organisms.
The microscope was instantly produced
for the purpose of ascertaining the nature of his find,
when, to his great disappointment, he discovered they
were simply grains of buckwheat&mdash;part of the stock
that had been laid in for our unfortunate fowls!</p>

<p>Our progress was tardy. On more than one
occasion we were actually farther off Cape Farewell,
the point of land we were striving to make, than on
the day previous!</p>

<p>As we approached Davis Straits, speculations were
rife as to when and where we should meet our first
ice. The greatest eagerness was shown by all on
board to become acquainted with the enemy whose
fastnesses we were preparing to attack and from
which we hoped to return victorious.</p>

<p>On the 25th of June, being still at some distance to
the southward of Cape Farewell, a vessel was sighted
steering in the opposite direction to ourselves. We
passed at too great a distance to avail ourselves of
such a favourable opportunity of sending letters to
England, though there were many on board who
showed an intense anxiety to communicate. We
suspected, and our reasoning proved correct, that
this would be the last vessel we should see for many
a long day, and she was consequently watched with
a great deal of interest. She was, in all probability,
a homeward bound Peterhead vessel laden with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
<i>cryolite</i>. The cryolite is a rare mineral and the sole
one which has become an article of trade in Greenland.
It is found only in one single spot called
Ivigtut in 61° 10&prime; N., imbedded like a massive body
in the granitic rock, and not in veins or strata. In
1857 a licence was granted to a private company for
working the cryolite, and in the first nine years
14,000 tons were exported in 80 ship-loads. During
the next nine years the total export amounted to
70,000 tons. Cryolite is converted by a chemical
process into soda and an alumina unequalled as
regards purity and fitness for the art of dyeing.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>As we neared the waters of Davis Straits, whales
were observed in great numbers. They were principally
what are called by the whalers &ldquo;bottle-noses.&rdquo;
This species of cetacean is the <i>Hyperoodon rostratus</i>,
and is from twenty to twenty-six feet long, with teeth
in the lower jaw. The &ldquo;bottle-noses&rdquo; are seldom
sought and captured by the whalers owing to the
small amount of oil that they yield, not more than a
few hundred-weight of blubber being derived from
each one of this species. A dead whale of the &ldquo;right&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Greenland&rdquo; sort was also passed. What a prize
for a whaler this would have been; worth about
£1,000! but of no value whatever to us, so it was
allowed to float by untouched. How the mouths of
our ice quarter-masters, all hailing from those
essentially whaling ports Dundee and Peterhead,
watered as they beheld what by them would have
undoubtedly been considered a god-send! The
evident look of wonder, not unmixed with contempt,
that showed itself upon their countenances was truly
ludicrous when they found that we were about to pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
so valuable a prize unheeded. This fish&mdash;for all
&ldquo;right&rdquo; whales (<i>Balæna mysticetus</i>) are denominated
&ldquo;fish&rdquo; by those engaged in their capture&mdash;had
probably been struck by some whaler and, having
succeeded in evading its persecutors, had since died
of its wounds; or else it had been killed by the
inveterate enemy of the whale the <i>Orca gladiator</i>, or
&ldquo;grampus,&rdquo; sometimes called &ldquo;sword-fish,&rdquo; which
pursues and harasses these harmless unoffending
leviathans of the deep whenever opportunities offer.
The rorqual, or &ldquo;finner&rdquo; (<i>Physalus antiquorum</i>), was
also seen; it is easily distinguished from the right
whale by the dorsal fin peculiar to this cetacean, and
from which it derives its name. The rorquals are
seldom captured, great difficulty being experienced in
killing these huge monsters, which are frequently
known to measure as much as ninety feet in length.
Scoresby mentions one measuring one hundred and
twenty feet. Great as is their size, however, the
amount of blubber to be obtained from them is very
insignificant. They feed upon cod-fish (as many as
eight or nine hundred have been found in the stomach
of one of these whales) and are constantly seen off
the south and west coast of Greenland.</p>

<p>A falling temperature on the 27th of June, and
a peculiar light blink along the horizon, gave us due
notice of the immediate proximity of ice. As the
weather was thick and foggy extra precautions were
adopted in order to guard against coming into serious
collision with any icebergs, for, however beautiful
these floating islands of ice may be during bright
clear weather, they are dangerous and formidable
foes when near and unseen.</p>

<p>True to the warning received, an iceberg was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
shortly afterwards sighted, and by 4 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> the ship
was steaming through loose detached fragments of
heavy floe ice.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the excitement that
prevailed on board on this first introduction of many
among us to that icy world in which we afterwards
lived for fifteen months. To me it gave rise to
reminiscences of old times, but to the uninitiated it
was an exciting scene, and was gazed upon with
intense interest.</p>

<p>The officer of the watch, desirous of having the
honour of making the ship first touch ice, and being
also under the impression that a reward of a bottle of
champagne would be given to him who should first
succeed in doing so, steered straight for a heavy piece
nearly submerged. His efforts were crowned with
success, but they were also accompanied by a gentle
admonition that for the future he should be a little
more careful of her Majesty&rsquo;s property, and avoid all
such fragments as were likely to knock a hole in the
bows of the ship.</p>

<p>On the following morning we sighted the high,
bold, and snow-capped hills in the neighbourhood of
Cape Desolation. This headland was so called by
that sturdy navigator, brave old John Davis, during
his first voyage of discovery in the year 1585. In
his quaint manner he describes &ldquo;the land being very
high and full of mightie mountaines all covered with
snowe, no viewe of wood, grasse, or earth to be seene,
and the shore for two leages into the sea so full of
yce as that no shipping cold by any meanes come
neere the same. The lothsome viewe of the shore,
and irksome noyse of the yce was such as that it bred
strange conceipts among us, so that we supposed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
place to be wast and voyd of any sencible or vegitable
creatures, whereupon I called the same Desolation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Icebergs were now constantly seen, some being of
very considerable dimensions, and looming in the
distance like real islands. As one of our men wittily
remarked on seeing his first iceberg, it reminded him
strongly of the Isle of Wight (white)!!</p>

<p>The streams of ice through which the vessel was
navigated were composed of fragments of heavy pack
ice, that had in all probability drifted down the east
coast of Greenland, and had been swept round Cape
Farewell. They were of very deep flotation, and
great care had to be taken in steering the ship
through, so as to avoid striking these pieces more
than was absolutely necessary; so heavily laden was
the ship, that the force of the blows in some instances
was very seriously felt.</p>

<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:761px; height:374px" src="images/img45.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">SEALS BASKING ON THE ICE.</td></tr></table>

<p>Seals were seen basking lazily and dreamily on the
ice, or following in our wake, staring inquisitively at
us with their large round eyes, looking for all the
world like human beings. The fabulous merman and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
mermaiden seemed to us easily accounted for. The
seals observed were of two descriptions&mdash;namely, the
<i>Pagomys f&oelig;tidus</i>, or &ldquo;floe-rat;&rdquo; and the <i>Pagophilus
Gr&oelig;nlandicus</i>, the &ldquo;saddle-back,&rdquo; or common Greenland
seal.</p>

<p>Birds, common to these regions, hovered around,
following us for days together and breaking the solitude
that surrounded us with their joyous and gladsome
presence.</p>

<p>The 1st of July was a beautiful, bright, clear,
sunny day, and to us was doubly welcome after the
continuous bad weather which until now had been
our lot. Not a ripple disturbed the calm surface of
the sea as it lay blue and gleaming in the sunshine.
Here and there a few small patches of ice reminded
us of our proximity to the Arctic circle, while a
certain sharp-bracing crispness in the air, together
with a rather low temperature, served to assure us
that the high snow-covered land in the distance was
in reality &ldquo;Greenland&rsquo;s icy mountains&rdquo;&mdash;no hymnal
myth as supposed by many, but grand ranges, devoid
of all verdure, wrapped in their snowy mantle, and
rising to an altitude of from two to three thousand
feet above the level of the sea, a majestic and sublime
reality.</p>

<p>By noon we were off the little Danish settlement
of Fiskernaes, and shortly afterwards passed that of
Godthaab, but at too great a distance to make out
the buildings or any signs of inhabitants. It was
at Godthaab that Hans Egede landed on July 3rd,
1721, with his wife and children, and commenced
his noble and disinterested labour of love among the
Eskimos. The missionary institutions founded by
Hans Egede and the Moravians have gradually incorporated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
the whole population of Greenland into
Christian communities.</p>

<p>The appearance of this part of the coast of Greenland
was very striking, especially to those who were
strangers to Arctic scenery. The mountains, with
their peaks so pointed as scarcely to admit of the
snow resting on their steep and almost precipitous
sides, intersected by grand fiords and gorges penetrating
for miles into the interior, formed a magnificent
landscape.</p>

<p>To the great relief and joy of all, we were on this
day rejoined by our consort the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; who,
like ourselves, had been roughly handled by the
tempestuous weather since we lost sight of her in
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Expecting to pass over the &ldquo;Torske&rdquo; banks, the
dredge was prepared, and fishing lines served out;
every one busy stretching and fitting their lines, and
smacking their lips over an anticipated dinner of
fresh cod and halibut. Soundings in thirty fathoms
having been obtained on one of these banks, the ship
was stopped and permission given to fish. Immediately
fifty or sixty fishing lines were over the side;
but, although our eager fishermen persevered for a
couple of hours, no capture rewarded their patience.
The &ldquo;wily cod&rdquo; remained sullen at the bottom, and
could not even be induced to &ldquo;nibble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dredge was also put over, and hauled in with
unimportant results, only a few echinoderms being
obtained.</p>

<p>During the night an iceberg of curious shape was
passed. When first seen it was reported as a sail;
on approaching it a little nearer it assumed the appearance
of a huge column-shaped basaltic rock, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
then that of a lighthouse; for some time it was really
believed to be the former.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July the Arctic circle was crossed.
From this date, for some weeks, we were to have
continuous day. The nights had for some time past
been getting gradually shorter: now they had ceased
altogether&mdash;candles and lamps were no longer necessary,
bright sunlight reigned paramount.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards the expedition was safely
anchored in the bay of Lievely, off the little Danish
settlement of Godhavn. Although small, it is the
most important establishment in the Inspectorate of
North Greenland, for here resides the Royal Inspector,
who controls, with absolute authority, the large mixed
population of Danes and Eskimos who inhabit this
the most northern civilized land in the world.</p>

<p>A salute of nine guns, from a small battery of three
diminutive specimens of ordnance, welcomed our
arrival, the smoke from which had scarcely blown
away before Mr. Krarup Smith, the Inspector, came
on board, anxious to offer assistance, and desirous
of extending the hospitalities of his house to the
members of the expedition.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more kind than the reception
accorded us by the inhabitants of this little settlement.
Their sole desire was to please and aid us in
every way, and we were soon firm and fast friends
with the innocent and simple-minded residents.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">It</span> was with a very pleasing sensation of relief that we
found the ship once more at rest, after thirty-four
days of such knocking about as is seldom experienced
at sea for so long a time without a break. The
rolling and pitching to which a small ship is subjected
in a heavy sea are never altogether agreeable,
and the quiet and repose of a snug well-protected
harbour are welcomed even by the &ldquo;veriest old sea-dog.&rdquo;
But, although free from the turmoil of the
&ldquo;angry waste of waters,&rdquo; our short stay at Godhavn
can scarcely be called a period of rest. Much had to
be done, coals had to be taken on board, and a nondescript
quantity of stores and provisions received
from the &ldquo;Valorous&rdquo; and stowed away.</p>

<p>The days were long, however. We had arrived in
the region where the midnight sun shone almost as
brightly and gave as much light as at noonday; and
if, in consequence, the men were kept longer at work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span>
than they otherwise would have been, they felt themselves
amply compensated for their extra labour by
the indulgence of a run on shore in the evening, and
an open-air dance with the dusky and light-hearted
beauties of the land.</p>

<p>Never did the deck of a man-of-war present such an
untidy and confused appearance as ours did after
receiving the last cask from the &ldquo;Valorous.&rdquo; Casks
and cases lay higgledy-piggledy amongst coals and
ropes. Such a scene as our upper deck presented
would have been sufficient to drive a smart first
lieutenant distracted. We were, however, all much
too practical to think of appearances, our sole thought
was to be provided with enough of everything to guard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
against all accidents. Between decks was a repetition
of the scene above, and it was with the greatest
difficulty we could move from one part of the ship to
the other. To add to the pleasing state of the vessel
twenty-four Eskimo dogs&mdash;the number was afterwards
augmented to thirty&mdash;were received on board, to be
used in our sledging operations. Such a howling lot!
No sooner did they arrive than a regular battle
ensued, and we were compelled for some days to tie
up a few of the most pugnacious, in order to secure
anything like peace.</p>

<p>This state of affairs, namely, the incessant fighting
and squabbling amongst the dogs, continued until one
had gained the acknowledged supremacy by thrashing
the whole pack. This happens in all well-regulated
dog communities. The conqueror is henceforth styled
the &ldquo;king&rdquo; dog; he rules his subjects with despotic
sway, frequently settling a quarrel between a couple
of pugilistic disputants, reserving for himself the best
of everything in the shape of food, the other dogs
yielding their tit-bits with cringing servility, exerting
a complete mastery over his canine subjects, and
exacting from them the most abject homage. The
dogs were kept as much as possible in the fore part of
the ship, and soon became great favourites with the
men.</p>

<p>To take charge of this unruly pack, we obtained
the services, through the kindness and assistance of
Mr. Krarup Smith, the Inspector, of a native Eskimo,
who with his gun and kayak was duly installed on
board in the capacity of dog-driver and interpreter.
He rejoiced in the name of Frederic, and had the
reputation of being a keen and successful hunter.
Although he could not boast of good looks, his bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
cheerful face and unvarying good temper soon made
him a friend to all on board.</p>

<p>The novelty of a never-ending day, for the first
time experienced by so many in the expedition, sadly
interfered with the natural time for rest and sleep.
Long past midnight would the sounds of music and
mirth be heard from the shore, as the dances were
kept up with unabated vigour; while shrieks of
laughter and merriment would be heard afloat, as
the officers, indulging in aquatic tastes, would be seen
rowing races in small collapsible boats, or trying
their skill for the first time in the frail kayak. For
the management of these latter fairy-like canoes great
caution is required&mdash;indeed, it is hardly possible to
manage them without much practice.</p>

<p>Our first lieutenant was, however, an exception to
this rule, for owing to experience acquired in canoes in
various parts of the world, he succeeded in the management
of the kayak so admirably as to excite the
surprise and admiration of the natives. W&mdash;&mdash;,
another of our officers, not to be outdone by his mess-mate,
also tried his skill in one of these little barks,
but he had not paddled many yards before it capsized,
leaving him head down in the water, with his legs
firmly jammed in the boat. He would undoubtedly
have been drowned before assistance could arrive had
he not shown a wonderful degree of presence of mind.
So securely was he fixed in his kayak, that it was
only by unbuttoning his braces and getting out of his
trousers that he succeeded in extricating himself from
his dangerous predicament, leaving that article of
dress inside the kayak!</p>

<p>In spite of the multifarious duties connected with
the ship, which kept every one fully occupied, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
pursuit of science was not neglected. Several complete
series of observations were obtained for the
determination of the magnetic force. Photographs
were taken, and geological and botanical collections
were extensively made, whilst a boat with the first
lieutenant and our energetic naturalist proceeded some
little distance up the coast to a place called Ovifak
for the purpose of obtaining information regarding
some &ldquo;meteorites&rdquo; reported to have fallen there.</p>

<p>The desire of &ldquo;stretching one&rsquo;s legs&rdquo; after being
cooped up on board ship for so long was universally
felt, and officers and men alike enjoyed a scramble
over the lofty volcanic cliffs which overlie the gneiss
in this part of the island of Disco.</p>

<p>The difficulty of the ascent of the Lyngenmarkfjeld,
a range of hills about two thousand feet in height,
situated on the northern side of the harbour, was
amply compensated for by the view from its summit.
Landing in a pretty little bay, in which lay the
remains of an old steam whaler, the &ldquo;Wildfire,&rdquo; that
had fallen a victim to the ice some years ago, and
emerging from the rather dense, though stunted,
vegetation that grows luxuriantly at the base of these
hills, the way led over precipitous basaltic cliffs, until
by dint of hard climbing the snow-clad heights were
reached.</p>

<p>The accomplishment of this task, however, was
both arduous and perilous, in consequence of the
action of the frost on the rocks of which the cliffs
were composed; for on the slightest touch they often
crumbled away, rolling with a mass of <i>débris</i> many
hundreds of feet to the bottom.</p>

<p>From the summit a glorious scene was revealed
to us. The mainland of Greenland, that land so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
&ldquo;wonderfull mountaynous, whose mountaynes all the
yeare long are full of yce and snowe,&rdquo; was distinctly
brought to our view, whilst immediately at our feet
was the picturesque settlement of Godhavn, and the
three vessels, resembling miniature toy-ships, lying
at anchor in its snug little harbour. The Whale-fish
Islands, a group in Disco Bay, lay spread out as it
were on a map. Hundreds of icebergs dotted the
perfectly placid sea, and beyond them we could plainly
discern the great ice fiord of Jacobshavn with its
gigantic discharging glacier behind, and the mouth
of its fiord almost choked with huge fragments of ice,
children of that same glacier. At brief intervals a
noise as of thunder or distant artillery announced the
disruption, or creation, of one of these wonderful
islands of ice.</p>

<p>We were not, however, allowed to enjoy this glorious
scene in quietness. Our pleasure was marred by the
attacks of swarms of musquitoes. These irritating
insects assailed us on first landing, and persecuted us
incessantly until we were again afloat.</p>

<p>It was indeed hard to meet so far in the icy north
our implacable enemies of the tropics!</p>

<p>The descent was as dangerous, though perhaps not
so laborious as the ascent. Occasionally we were
able to avail ourselves of patches of snow, down which
we slid, much to the astonishment and discomfiture of
my dog Nellie, who was at a loss to understand the
means of our rapid progress, and who rushed down
after us barking frantically.</p>

<p>We were excessively fortunate in our weather during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
our brief stay at Godhavn. We rejoiced in ceaseless
sunshine, which lit up the surrounding hills with a
golden light, throwing deep dark shadows into the
valleys and ravines by which they were intersected,
whilst the bright rays of the sun glittering on the ice-strewn
surface of the sea formed a scene at once
novel and sublime.</p>

<p>Our short stay at Godhavn will, I think, always be
regarded with pleasure by the members of the expedition.
Nothing could exceed the kindness we received
and the hospitality that was extended to us by the
good people on shore, who appeared to vie with each
other in their endeavours to render our visit an agreeable
one. Nor was it only from the inhabitants that
we received so much kindness. The captain, officers,
and indeed I may say the ship&rsquo;s company of the
&ldquo;Valorous&rdquo; were unremitting in their exertions to
provide us with every necessary that it was in their
power to supply, for the furtherance of the arduous
service in which we were so soon to be engaged,
depriving themselves of many things that they thought
would add to our comfort.</p>

<p>Although the Eskimos, according to Dr. Rink, and
we can have no better authority respecting the natives
of Greenland, have a pretty fair talent for writing and
drawing, scarcely any traces of sculpture belonging to
earlier times remain, with the exception of a few small
images cut out in wood or bone, which had probably
served children as playthings. Notwithstanding the
want of means for handing down to posterity and retaining
historical events amongst this interesting
people, many traditions and legends have been preserved.
Among the number is one relating to this
island of Disco. It was supposed to have been situated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
off the southern coast of Greenland, and in consequence
of its cutting off the inhabitants of the mainland
from the open sea, a great dislike was entertained
for it; for, to live comfortably, an Eskimo must be in
the vicinity of the sea, so as to follow his usual avocation
of seal hunting.</p>

<p>The story relates that two old men, having set their
wise heads together, determined to attempt the
removal of the island with the aid of magic. A third
old gentleman, however, desired to retain it in its position.
The first two, launching their kayaks, fastened
the hair of a little child to the island wherewith to tow
it by; whilst the other, from the shore, attempted to
keep it back by means of a sealskin thong. Desperately
did the two kayakers labour at their paddles
in their endeavours to move the island, chanting their
spells as they tugged at the hair. But as resolutely
did the third man hold on to his thong, straining
every nerve to render their exertions abortive; suddenly,
to his chagrin, the thong parted, and the island floated
off, and was towed away triumphantly to the northward,
where it was deposited in its present position.</p>

<p>Another tradition says it was removed from Baal&rsquo;s
River to its present site by a famous angekok, or
magician, and that the harbour of Godhavn is the
actual hole in the island to which the tow rope was
fastened.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of July the 15th, amidst much
firing of guns and dipping of flags, the little squadron
steamed out of the harbour, threading its way through
innumerable icebergs, and passing along the high
snow-clad hills that adorn the southern end of the
island of Disco, proceeded towards the settlement of
Ritenbenk, at which we arrived the following morning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
The scenery as we approached the anchorage was
truly magnificent. Lofty hills encompassed us on
either hand, down whose steep sides the water was
pouring in rapid cascades, produced by the thawing of
the snow on their summits. How full of life and joy
appeared these bright sparkling streams as they
seemed to chase each other in wanton sport, skipping
from rock to crag in their headlong career, until lost
in one large sheet of glistening spray that poured
over the edge of a precipitous cliff into the clear still
water at its base!</p>

<p>Thousands of birds congregate along the inaccessible
ledges of these cliffs, perched in such precise order,
and having such a uniformity of colour, that they
resemble regiments of soldiers drawn up in readiness
to defend their fortresses from the attacks of ruthless
invaders. But fresh food was at a premium, and the
wretched looms were doomed to suffer a long assault
at the hands of our energetic sportsmen.</p>

<p>Other and more weighty matters also required our
attention. We were to bid farewell to the &ldquo;Valorous&rdquo;
on the following morning. And with her we should
lose the last connecting link with home.</p>

<p>Letters had to be hurriedly finished, and then we
had to bid adieu to one to whose untiring energy the
departure of the expedition was due, who had been
mainly instrumental in obtaining the sanction of
Government for its dispatch, and who, leaving the
comforts of a home life, had accompanied us thus far
on our journey, sharing our discomforts, but adding to
our knowledge from his rich fund of information, and
enlivening our mess-table with his conversation and
presence.</p>

<p>We felt, whilst he was on board, that we were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
quite separated from the civilized world. His departure
made a chasm that it was difficult for some time
to bridge over, but the memory of him lived long
amongst us, and served to recall many a pleasant and
happy hour.</p>

<p>At four o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 17th the
&ldquo;Valorous&rdquo; steamed away from us on her way to the
coal quarries on the north side of the island of Disco,
and, two hours after, the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; and ourselves
put to sea, having increased the number of our dogs
by purchasing several from the natives at Ritenbenk.</p>

<p>The scenery in the Waigat, a strait separating the
island of Disco from the mainland of Greenland, is
very grand. The channel was rendered almost impassable
from the number of icebergs of every fantastic
form and shape that lay scattered about, and which,
although adding materially to the beauty of the scene,
made the passage one of no little intricacy: indeed we
very narrowly escaped losing all our boats on one
side of the ship by shaving a large iceberg a little too
closely!</p>

<p>On one side were the high snow-clad hills of Disco,
intersected by deep and narrow ravines, whilst on the
opposite side was a bold and lofty coast with precipitous
headlands ending in needle-shaped peaks and
separated by glaciers and fiords. Passing the beautiful
large discharging glacier of Itivdliarsuk, many
minor ones opened to our view as we sailed slowly
past, presenting a panorama such as it would be
impossible to depict faithfully on canvas.</p>

<p>Several remarkable red patches, apparently of
basalt, were observed on the bare gneiss hills in the
vicinity of Point Kardluk, which is noted for the
large quantity of vegetable fossils that have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
found there, and close to the petrified forest of Atanekerdluk.</p>

<p>Catching sight of the &ldquo;Valorous&rdquo; at anchor, busily
engaged in procuring coal, we endeavoured to reach
her, for the purpose of sending a few stray letters that
had been inadvertently left behind; but a thick fog
overtaking us, we were very reluctantly compelled to
relinquish all idea of communicating, and had to be
satisfied with reading the signal of &ldquo;farewell&rdquo; and
&ldquo;good wishes&rdquo; that she threw out. It was fortunately
distinguished before the vessels were effectually concealed
from each other by an impervious fog which
crept over the surface of the sea, hiding everything
around us, though high above our heads the mountain
tops were clearly to be seen.</p>

<p>So dense did it become that we were, after a time,
obliged to make the ships fast to icebergs to await a
more favourable opportunity of advancing.</p>

<p>Whilst attempting to secure the ships an alarming
catastrophe occurred. The boat had been dispatched
containing three men with the necessary implements,
such as an ice drill and anchor, for making the vessel
fast.</p>

<p>As soon as the first blow of the drill was delivered
the berg, to our horror, split in two with a loud
report, one half with one of our men on it toppling
completely over, whilst the other half swayed rapidly
backwards and forwards. On this latter piece was
another of our men, who was observed with his heels
in the air, the violent agitation of the berg having
precipitated him head foremost into a rent or crevasse.
The water alongside was a mass of seething foam and
spray; but curious to relate, the boat with the third
man in it was in no way injured. They were all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
speedily rescued from their perilous position and
brought on board, sustaining no further harm than
that inflicted by a cold bath. Their escape appeared
miraculous.</p>

<p>By the next morning we were through the Waigat
Strait. Much to our disappointment the weather
remained thick, and we were in consequence unable
to gratify ourselves with a sight of the truly grand
scenery to be found at the mouth of the Omenak
fiord, which possesses some of the largest discharging
glaciers in Greenland.</p>

<p>On the night of the 19th both vessels came to an
anchor off the Danish settlement of Proven.</p>

<p>The harbour, which is small, is formed by two
islands. On the western side of the easternmost of
the two is situated the quaintest of quaint little
settlements. It consists of a neat little church, the
Governor&rsquo;s residence, the storehouse, boiling down
establishment, smithy, about two other wooden habitations,
and some igdlus, or Eskimo huts. Of course it
boasts its flagstaff and battery of three guns. The
Governor, who, in his endeavour to be civil, had
boarded us before anchoring, apologized for not
saluting, saying &ldquo;that though he had the guns he
had no artillerists.&rdquo; Although it was midnight before
we arrived, the inhabitants were lining the side of the
hill as we entered, the white boots and fur jackets and
short trousers of the women affording a very novel
though picturesque scene.</p>

<p>The dogs on shore, evidently annoyed at being
disturbed in their slumbers, set up a fearful howling,
which, being answered by the dogs in both ships,
produced a most unpleasant and discordant concert.
The natives have a saying, when the dogs make this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
noise, &ldquo;that they are holding their parliament.&rdquo;
This is hardly flattering to the Greenland senate!</p>

<p>During our short stay at this place a rough survey
of the harbour was taken, and a number of scientific
observations were made.</p>

<p>Nothing could be kinder or more friendly than the
reception met with from all on shore. In the
Governor&rsquo;s good wife I recognized an old acquaintance
whom I had had the pleasure of meeting on a
former occasion during a cruise in a whaler to these
regions.</p>

<p>Here also we succeeded in engaging the services of
Hans Hendrik, an Eskimo, as dog-driver and hunter.
This man had been employed in the same capacity in
all the American expeditions to Smith&rsquo;s Sound, and
was an invaluable acquisition.</p>

<p>Our men enjoyed themselves every evening during
our stay, dancing to their hearts&rsquo; content.</p>

<p>My black retriever, Nellie, was a great object of
admiration amongst the inhabitants, one man especially
being very pertinacious in his request that she
might be presented to him. On inquiring to what
use he would put her, I was informed that my faithful
companion would be converted into food for the man&rsquo;s
oily-faced family, whilst her beautiful black curly coat
would serve to adorn his wife&rsquo;s person. Nellie, I
think, had some notion of the designs on her life and
skin, as in future she always regarded with disfavour
not only the Eskimos themselves, but also their dogs
and everything belonging to them.</p>

<p>Leaving Proven on the evening of the 21st of July,
we arrived on the same night off a remarkable headland
called &ldquo;Sanderson, his hope.&rdquo; It was so named
by old John Davis, after his friend and patron, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
W. Sanderson, in 1587, and was the extreme northern
point reached by him during his third voyage.<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>This prominent and precipitous cliff is a famous
place for looms, as those white-breasted guillemots
are termed, which are considered such rare delicacies
on an Arctic table. They are the <i>Uria Brunnichii</i> of
naturalists, and are numerous in sub-Arctic regions.
Their favourite breeding-places are along these terraced
cliffs, where they assemble in large quantities.</p>

<p>Of course so favourable an opportunity of procuring
fresh food was not to be disregarded. The ships were
hove to, and the boats, crammed with eager sportsmen,
dispatched for the purpose of shooting for the
&ldquo;pot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myriads of these birds were congregated along the
face of the steep precipitous cliffs, in some places
almost overhanging, which rose abruptly to an altitude
of about a thousand feet. Owing, however, to the
unsteadiness of the boats, caused by the roughness of
the sea, our &ldquo;bag&rdquo; did not realize our anticipations.
Many of the birds that were shot remained on the
inaccessible ledges of the rocks, and were therefore lost
to us; and many fell into the sea beyond, and were
no more seen.</p>

<p>The midnight sun was shining brightly during this
<i>battue</i>, and we returned to the ship, after a couple of
hours&rsquo; sport, the richer by one hundred and seventy
birds, each equal in weight to a fair-sized duck. For
the succeeding three or four days we revelled in
&ldquo;loom soup,&rdquo; &ldquo;loom pie,&rdquo; or &ldquo;roast loom,&rdquo; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
looms cooked in every imaginable form. No matter
how they were served up, they were always pronounced
to be delicious. Indeed, one of my messmates
went so far as to say that he had never tasted
anything better in his life. In fact, for the purpose
of thoroughly enjoying a good dinner, a trip to the
Arctic regions is indispensable!</p>

<p>On the following morning we anchored off Upernivik,<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
the most northern settlement but one in
Greenland. It is situated on one of the Woman
Islands, so named by Baffin in 1616. The usual
kindness and hospitality were extended to us here, as
at all the other Danish settlements visited. We also
received important information concerning the state of
the ice to the northward, with a tabulated statement
of all the meteorological observations obtained during
the previous winter, a study of which would be of the
greatest importance to us.</p>

<p>In the evening, taking the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; in tow, we
again put to sea, this time finally bidding farewell to
civilization. From henceforth our energies and our
thoughts must turn Polewards.</p>

<p>As the last glimpse of the little church was shut
out from our view, many a prayer was silently offered
to Him in his infinite mercy to protect and guide us
in our endeavours, and to vouchsafe us a safe return
again to home and civilization.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Threading</span> our way through narrow passages between
numerous islands that lay to the eastward of Upernivik,
and trusting to the knowledge and guidance of
an Eskimo pilot, we felt at length that we had in
reality, seen the last for some time, of our fellow men,
and that our struggle with the almost insuperable
difficulties of the frozen north was about to commence.</p>

<p>Preparations for an unsuccessful combat with the
ice were made, and every precaution was adopted
necessary to ensure the safety of the men, in cases of
extreme emergency. The boats were prepared for
immediate service, each man having his allotted
station, so that little or no confusion would ensue if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
the abandonment of the ships should be decided upon&mdash;an
event that was by no means improbable. Ice-saw
crews were organized in readiness for cutting a dock,
in case such a proceeding should become necessary
for the protection of the vessels. Provisions and
clothes were so arranged along the upper deck that
they could easily and readily be thrown out on the ice
at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Knapsacks, each containing
two pairs of blanket wrappers, one pair of hose, one
pair of stockings, one pair of mitts, one pair of
drawers, a Welsh wig, a jersey, a comforter, a pair of
moccasins, a towel and small piece of soap, were
packed and placed in some handy position where they
could be reached without delay. The necessary
tackles for lifting the screw and unshipping the rudder
were provided: in fact every preparation was made
that could possibly be thought of to guard against
accidents and to promote success in the forthcoming
conflict.</p>

<p>On the morning after leaving Upernivik, on account
of a dense fog, it was determined to anchor off one
of the small islands composing a group through
which we were passing, in order to wait for finer
weather.</p>

<p>Our pilot, getting into his kayak, offered to pioneer
us into a little bay with which he was intimately
acquainted. Being totally unable to realize the
difference of size between the large unwieldy &ldquo;Alert&rdquo;
and his own frail little bark, and probably imagining
that where he was able to go in his tiny boat, we also
could do the same, he led us close in to the land,
which, on account of the thick fog, was hidden from
our view, and we soon had the annoyance of finding
our ship hard and fast on shore. Fortunately we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
were going very slow at the time, so that no injury
was sustained; but we remained immoveable for
many hours until the flood-tide floated us and enabled
us once more to proceed.</p>

<p>The dangers connected with a passage through
Melville Bay are now so well known to all who have
taken any interest in Arctic affairs, or who have devoted
any time to the perusal of Arctic literature, that it is
needless for me either to explain or dwell upon them
at any length. Many a well-equipped ship has been
caught in the fatal embrace of this bay. What tales
of woe and disaster could its icy waters unfold,
coupled, however, with deeds of heroic daring, endurance,
and suffering!</p>

<p>Captain Nares, determining to avoid the ordinary
passage through this once dreaded bay, the dangers
of which in these days of steam have been so
materially lessened, pushed his ships boldly through
what is generally termed the &ldquo;middle ice.&rdquo; This, at
such a late season of the year, is undoubtedly a wise
course; but woe to the unfortunate ship that at an
earlier period should be caught in this moving pack,
and be there detained for thirteen or fourteen months,
as the little &ldquo;Fox&rdquo; was, under the command of Sir
Leopold McClintock!</p>

<p>If the pack is composed of loose light ice, such as
we found it to be, rendering a passage through it one
of no difficulty, it may also be presumed that the ice
in Melville Bay at the same time would be of the
same consistency, thereby also affording an easy and
safe passage through.</p>

<p>The reason that the passage by Melville Bay is
always taken by the whalers is the existence of fixed
land ice, which is found adhering to the shores, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
in which it is easy to cut a dock for the preservation
of the ship if the heavy pack is forced by wind, or
otherwise, towards it, thereby endangering any vessel
that may happen to be between the two. Directly
the pack moves off the vessel is liberated and proceeds
on her voyage.</p>

<p>It would be very different if the ship was caught in
the pack. Then she would, in all probability, be
severely handled, and being beset would drift to the
southward with the ice and thereby lose all the
hard-fought ground gained with so much labour and
fatigue.</p>

<p>One of the most important maxims in ice navigation,
which is strictly followed out by the whalers, is
&ldquo;stick to the land-ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were certainly extremely fortunate in finding
the pack so &ldquo;loose&rdquo; as to give us little trouble or
difficulty in making progress. The ice was of a soft
&ldquo;brashy&rdquo; nature, apparently only of one year&rsquo;s
formation, and only from one to three feet in thickness.
The weather being fine and calm, advantage
was taken of it to steam full speed, for there was no
saying how quickly the ice might pack with even a
light breeze. The tow rope was accordingly cast off,
and we proceeded at our highest rate of speed with
the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; following close at our heels.</p>

<p>Occasionally our progress would be checked by a
stream of ice extending across the lane of water
through which we were steering; but through these
obstructions we bored, or charged them at full speed,
and thus cleared a way. A walrus and a few seals
were seen on the ice, but their capture did not hold
out sufficient inducement to detain the ship.</p>

<p>Very different from the apathy shown on passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
these animals was the excitement exhibited when a
bear, a veritable Polar bear, was seen on the ice.
Such a rush for rifles and weapons of all descriptions!
It was the first and only bear seen, and therefore the
excitement its presence caused was natural. Every
one appeared to share in it. Bear-skins were certainly
on that day at a premium, for all were eager and
anxious to become the fortunate possessor of such a
prize. Master Bruin, however, did not reciprocate
this feeling, and evinced an equal amount of anxiety
to retain his nice warm coat.</p>

<p>The engines were immediately stopped, and the
boats crammed with volunteer hunters. These landing
on the ice, advanced upon their quarry in skirmishing
order, while the ship, steaming round to the opposite
side of the floe, endeavoured to cut off his retreat.
All was ineffectual. Bruin&rsquo;s strategic abilities were
of too high an order for us to cope successfully with
him in his own territories, and he escaped. Many
rounds of ammunition, however, were fired at him
both from the party on shore and also by those on
board the ship, in the faint hope that a lucky shot
might bring him down. To this day there are many
who seriously believe that he carried away with him a
portion of the bullets they so lavishly expended. So
keen were some in the ardour and excitement of the
chase that they rushed on, heedless of the rotten and
treacherous nature of the ice, until an immersion in
the cold water brought them to a sense of their
danger and compelled them to seek refuge on board
the ship, wet, cold, and uncomfortable. Many little
rotges (<i>Alca alle</i>) were flitting about from the ice to
the water, and the beautiful ivory gull (<i>Larus eburneus</i>)
was also seen for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span></p>

<p>In thirty-four hours from first encountering the ice
we reached the North Water, and our troubles were
for a time at an end. It was an unprecedented
passage. Only seventy hours from Upernivik to Cape
York!</p>

<p>Melville Bay, with all its terrors, was behind us; a
beautifully smooth unruffled sea, devoid of all ice,
was in front; everything pointed to success, and the
hearts of all in the expedition beat high with joy and
delight at the speedy prospect of attaining the utmost
realization of their hopes. Large icebergs were
around us in every direction; but what cared we then
for icebergs? We had continuous day; the North
Water had been reached; our way lay northwards.
In a few short days the entrance of Smith Sound
would be reached, the threshold of the unknown
region crossed, and then onwards to&mdash;where? We
did not dare to anticipate, but we felt that the first
step towards success had been gained, and that we
had commenced our real work under most propitious
circumstances. We would not predict, but we determined
to deserve, success.</p>

<p>It was, for many reasons, a matter of congratulation
that this &ldquo;North Water&rdquo; had been so speedily and
so successfully reached. Instead of only two or three
weeks of the navigable season being available for us
to penetrate the hidden mysteries of Smith Sound,
owing to our rapid passage, we could reckon upon a
clear month or five weeks before being compelled to
secure our ship in winter quarters; besides which,
our fuel had been very materially saved by this quick
run, and this in itself, to ships situated as we were,
was no unimportant matter.</p>

<p>On reaching the neighbourhood of Cape York, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
&ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; was ordered to proceed shorewards for
the purpose of communicating with the natives (the
Arctic Highlanders of Sir John Ross), in the hope of
inducing one of their number, a brother-in-law of
Hans, to accompany the expedition; the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; in
the mean time shaping a course to the Cary Islands,
at which latter place the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; was ordered to
rejoin us.</p>

<p>The scenery, as we steamed along at a distance of
about two miles from the shore, was most interesting.
The hills along the coast were entirely clad with snow,
whilst the long undulating ranges, as they receded far
back to the horizon, appeared to be buried under the
everlasting <i>mer de glace</i>. Numerous glaciers of various
sizes, some of them being discharging ones, rolled
down to the water&rsquo;s edge in one vast icy sheet. The
width of one of these, the Petowik Glacier, is fully
seven miles. Fragments from these lay scattered
along the coast in every direction, whilst we had to
thread our way through clusters of huge bergs of
every form and size. Passing the crimson cliffs of
Beverley, we were able to distinguish, in a few small
patches, the so-called coloured snow whence the name
originates; but not in the highly imaginative mass of
bright colour depicted by Sir John Ross, in his interesting
illustrated work describing his voyage to
Baffin Bay. The question of the nature of this
colouring matter on snow has now been definitely set
at rest. It is an alga, the <i>Protococcus nivalis</i>.</p>

<p>We did not reach the Cary Islands so soon as we
expected, in consequence of experiencing a strong
S.E. current that had not been anticipated. A sudden
rise of temperature of the surface water naturally led
us to suppose that it must be due to the absence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
ice, which, raising our spirits, made us regard with
displeasure any hindrance to our progress.</p>

<p>Arriving off the Cary group early on the morning of
the 27th, we were detained for a few hours landing a
boat with a large depôt of provisions, sufficient to
sustain 60 men for two months, or 120 men for one
month. The depôt was placed on the easternmost
island, and a large cairn was erected on the highest
and most prominent point. Here also were deposited
the last home letters which our friends were destined
to receive until after our own arrival in England.</p>

<p>The depôt was established as a safeguard for us to
fall back upon in case of any accident happening to
our vessels in Smith Sound. From this position it
was expected that a party duly provisioned would have
little difficulty in reaching the northern Greenland
settlements, or at any rate the simple but hospitable
natives of Cape York, who would, it was anticipated,
afford us protection and assistance. This duty having
been accomplished, and having been rejoined by our
consort, the northward course was resumed.<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>Crossing over to the eastward we steamed along on
that beautifully clear sunny morning within a short
distance of the western shores of Greenland. With
the exception of icebergs, not a speck of ice was to be
seen to disturb the smooth glassy surface of the sea.
Passing the mouth of Whale Sound we made rapid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
progress northwards, steering between Northumberland
and Hakluyt Islands, almost under their steep,
precipitous, and in some places overhanging cliffs; on
past Murchison Sound with the Crystal Palace
glacier ahead, whilst on our port bow was easily
discernible the opposite coast of Ellesmere Land, with
the Prince of Wales Mountains, covered with snow or
ice, rising above the western horizon.</p>

<p>It was indeed a glorious sight as we passed close to
this little known land, opening out, as we proceeded,
its many and large glaciers glittering white and
radiant in the sunshine, growing, as it were, out of the
clouds and rolling down grandly towards the sea,
until the opaque masses plunged sullenly and silently
into the deep blue water.</p>

<p>Animal life, so far as the feathered tribes were concerned,
appeared in abundance. The lively little
rotges or little auks (<i>Alca alle</i>) were seen in frequent
clusters diving quickly under water as the ship
approached. Looms (<i>Uria Brunnichii</i>), dovekies (<i>Uria
grylle</i>), and king-ducks (<i>Somateria spectabilis</i>), alarmed
at our appearance, rose in long flights, and circled
around us uttering their discordant cries. The
glaucous gull and the pretty kittiwake (<i>Larus tridactylus</i>)
soared above our heads, whilst occasionally
a graceful ivory gull (<i>Larus eburneus</i>) flapped its way
leisurely along, its snowy wings contrasting with the
background of clear blue sky. Here and there, on
small fragments of floating ice, were seen huge
walruses basking in the golden sunshine. Amid such
scenes, which to be realized must be seen, the two
vessels wended their way towards the entrance of
Smith Sound, all elated with the fair prospect that was
before them and hopeful for the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span></p>

<p>At half-past seven on the morning of the 28th of
July both ships came to an anchor in Hartstene Bay,
more commonly known as Port Foulke, the harbour
in which Dr. Hayes wintered in 1860.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1d" id="ft1d" href="#fa1d"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The Cary Islands consist of a group of eight islands, besides small
rocks or islets, and are situated in Baffin Bay, in lat. 76° 45&prime; N. They
vary in size from two and a half miles in diameter downwards. They
are composed of syenitic and porphyritic granite, overlaid in places
with gneiss. They rise to a height of about 400 feet above the level
of the sea, and possess a luxuriant vegetation, at least for these
regions. They are much frequented as breeding places by the eider-ducks
and looms.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">No</span> sooner were the ships secured and breakfast discussed,
than there was a regular rush for the shore.
Some went for a scramble over the neighbouring
glacier, named by Dr. Kane, &ldquo;My brother John&rsquo;s
glacier;&rdquo; some went to collect specimens; others to
take various scientific observations; and others to
hunt and shoot&mdash;this spot having been found
wonderfully prolific of game, more especially of
reindeer, during Dr. Hayes&rsquo;s stay. No signs of any
inhabitants were visible. This surprised us, as we
were fully expecting to meet the natives of the village
of Etah, situated only a couple of miles from the
anchorage. A visit to the village during the course
of the day proved the huts to be standing, but quite
deserted. Traces of their having been recently inhabited
were manifest, and portions of seal and walrus
meat were discovered in <i>caches</i>, as if the migration was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
only temporary and a return was meditated. No
other signs, however, of any living human being were
found.</p>

<p>Leaving to others the exploration of the country in
the immediate vicinity of the harbour, Captain Nares
and myself started, in one of the whale-boats, with
four men, for the purpose of visiting Life-boat Cove,
where some of the officers and crew of the &ldquo;Polaris&rdquo;
spent their second winter, 1872-3, and also to search
for an iron boat on Littleton Island, said to have been
left there by Dr. Hayes in 1860.</p>

<p>Sailing round Sunrise Point, we encountered a fresh
northerly wind dead in our teeth, against which, under
oars, we made but slow progress, whilst the cold spray
flew aft into our faces where it almost froze. After
about five hours&rsquo; hard pulling Life-boat Cove was
reached, and very glad we all were to get on shore
and stretch our legs and restore the circulation of our
blood.</p>

<p>Immediately on landing we met with traces of the
late occupants. These consisted of a large cairn&mdash;which,
however, had been demolished by others
previous to our arrival, probably by the searching
expedition sent out in the &ldquo;Tigress&rdquo; in 1873&mdash;a
basket lined with tin, and a trunk, neither of which
contained anything of importance; indeed, their contents
and the strong odour pervading them convinced
us that they were now the property of Eskimos.
Strolling on a little further, a boat was seen, which,
although somewhat of European shape, appeared to be
of Eskimo construction, as it was simply a framework
covered with skins; yet it was undoubtedly built
under a white man&rsquo;s superintendence.</p>

<p>Continuing to advance until we reached the western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
extreme of the spit of land on which we had landed,
we conjectured, from the amount of <i>débris</i> by which
we were surrounded, although no remains of a house
were visible, that we were on the site of the Americans&rsquo;
winter quarters. Trunks, boxes, stoves, pieces of wood,
gun-barrels, and odds and ends of all descriptions lay
strewed about over an area of half a square mile&mdash;a
desolate scene of ruin and misery!</p>

<p>Some of the boxes were marked with the names of
their previous owners, and contained, amongst other
things, books, principally relating to the Arctic regions.
One trunk contained a few small articles of female
apparel, such as a lace collar and black veil, and some
faded ribbons; souvenirs from some fair damsel at
home, which had probably, from the thoughts their
presence created, beguiled many a long and lonely
hour during the monotonous winter night. Numerous
cairns and <i>caches</i>, under which were deposited lumps of
seal blubber, led us to suppose that the natives intended
returning, especially with such a mine of
wealth to attract them as an abundance of wood and
iron, so invaluable to an Eskimo.</p>

<p>Two other boats were also found, constructed in the
same rude manner as the first. On one was painted,
in good large letters, the word MAUMOKPO; though
what it meant we were at a loss to conceive, but concluded
it was an Icelandic name.</p>

<p>Two Casella thermometers, marked as low as 130°
below zero, were also picked up in perfect order. It
is to be regretted that these were not self-registering
maximum and minimum thermometers, as it would
have been most interesting to have ascertained the
greatest amount of heat and cold at this spot during a
period of more than two years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span></p>

<p>Collecting everything that we considered of the
least value, such as books and instruments, for the
purpose of returning them to the United States
Government, and taking possession of a couple of boats,
which we thought would prove useful at some of our
depôts, we embarked and proceeded towards Littleton
Island, with our prizes in tow. Diligent search was
made for the pendulum said to have been left by the
&ldquo;Polaris&rdquo; people, but without success: also for the
box chronometers and transit instrument, but with a
like result. We could only come to the conclusion
that, if these articles had been left there, somebody
had been before us. Every cairn and <i>cache</i> was
thoroughly examined, and so was every nook and
crannie within a radius of half a mile from where we
imagined the house had originally stood. A chronometer-box
was picked up, but empty.</p>

<p>On landing at Littleton Island a careful search was
instituted for Hayes&rsquo;s boat, but, although we made
the complete circuit of the island, we failed to discover
any traces of it whatever. At the south-west
end we erected a cairn on the highest hill, about five
or six hundred feet above the level of the sea, and
obtained a round of angles with the theodolite. The
view from the top of this hill was very cheering.
Cape Sabine was distinctly visible; whilst farther to
the northward could be seen the land about Cape
Fraser, with <i>no signs of ice</i>! We were, however, too
wary to indulge to excess in hopeful anticipations,
knowing full well the vagaries of our capricious
enemy, the ice; but still such a scene could not but
tend to cheer and exhilarate, and send us back to our
ship with light and buoyant hearts.</p>

<p>It was past midnight before we reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
&ldquo;Alert.&rdquo; Our sportsmen, we found, had been unsuccessful
in their endeavours to shoot any reindeer;
one, however, fell to the rifle of an officer of the
&ldquo;Discovery.&rdquo; Very few were seen, and those so
wild as to render an approach within range no easy
matter. Several ducks and a few hares, however,
were obtained.</p>

<p>Leaving Port Foulke on the following morning, we
crossed over to the west side, and erected a large
cairn on the summit of Cape Isabella, about one
thousand feet above the level of the sea. The ascent
of this headland was both arduous and dangerous.
The face of the cliff was very precipitous, and it was
only by a zig-zag course that it could be effected. At
one moment the way led over loose shingle, that gave
way under the feet at every step; at another over a
broad patch of frozen snow, one false step on whose
slippery surface would precipitate one many hundred
feet below; and at another we were clinging desperately
with hands and feet to the hard, smooth, syenitic
granite rocks, of which this cape is composed. Very
thankful were we when the summit was reached; but
much more so when we found ourselves again at its
base, sound in wind and limb. To add to the difficulties,
there was a high wind and dense snowstorm.</p>

<p>At a less high elevation, and in a secure niche
amongst the rocks, were deposited an empty cask and
about one hundred and fifty pounds of preserved beef.
The cask was intended for the reception of any letters
that might be brought up by a Government ship in
the following year, or by any enterprising and adventurous
whaling captain who should penetrate so
far in order to bring us news. The provisions were
left as a small depôt for any sledging party that might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
be dispatched to the southward. The site was
marked by a small cairn. Records were left at each
of these cairns detailing the movements and the
prospects of the expedition, together with instructions
regarding our letters, should any be brought thus far.</p>

<p>Some beautiful little yellow poppies were gathered
on the slopes and crests of the hill, whilst the draba
and saxifrage were found growing in profusion.</p>

<p>The navigation of these icy seas is most uncertain!
Within twenty-four hours of the time that, from the
summit of Littleton Island, we had been cheered by
the view of an apparently open sea free of ice, and
extending in our imagination for miles to the northward,
we were battling with the pack, consisting of
large floes and loose broken-up fields, that extended
on both sides of us and as far north as we could see.
From this period our troubles commenced; from this
date our progress was one endless and unceasing
struggle with the ice: ever on the watch, and never
allowing a favourable opportunity to pass unheeded.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving Cape Isabella the ice was
observed stretching across Baird Inlet&mdash;the fixed land
ice with loose detached streams. As we proceeded
more ice was seen, which by degrees completely surrounded
us, and we only succeeded, after much boring
and charging, in forcing a way through, and into a
well-protected little harbour to the southward of Cape
Sabine. This bay was formed by a deep indentation
in the land having a long jutting-out spit to the S.E.
which acted as a famous breakwater, and was protected
seawards by Brevoort Island. Here we were
detained for five days, although several attempts were
made to proceed, which resulted in one instance in a
hopeless besetment in the ice for some hours. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
pack was impenetrable; our only hope was to wait
patiently for a strong wind to open out a passage.
The place was in consequence called &ldquo;Bide-a-wee&rdquo;
Harbour, subsequently changed to Payer Harbour,
after the distinguished Austrian Arctic explorer of
that name.</p>

<p>During our detention the time of the officers was
not unprofitably spent. A rough survey of the place
was made, its position was correctly ascertained, a
series of magnetic observations were obtained, and
long walks were taken in the neighbourhood, during
which a large and rich collection was made in the
interests of geology and botany. No game of any
description was seen. Traces of Eskimo were discovered,
but evidently of an ancient date. They
consisted of the remains of igdlus or huts, also some
bone spear-heads, and the runners and cross-bars of
a sledge.<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Tidal observations were also taken in the
harbour.</p>

<p>Here also, it may be said, we received our first
lessons in the art of sledging; for, wishing to be
initiated into its mysteries, a party, consisting of four
officers and five men dragging one of our large twenty-feet
ice boats on a sledge, started to travel over the
pack. Our main object was of course to derive some
practical experience in this all-important mode of
Arctic exploration, and in this, I think, we succeeded.</p>

<p>We found the ice exceedingly hummocky, with
narrow water spaces between, <i>just</i> too broad to admit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
of our jumping over, yet not sufficiently wide to
launch the boat into. So rough was the road that at
one time the bows of the boat would be seen rising
almost perpendicularly in the air, whilst all hands
were engaged in long-standing pulls on the drag-ropes
to the tune of &ldquo;one, two, three, haul;&rdquo; at another
time the sledge would come down the side of a
hummock with such rapidity as to give us hardly
time to spring out of the way to avoid the sledge and
boat coming over us, and many were the falls in
consequence. It was, however, rare fun. Once while
launching the boat into a pool of water she nearly
capsized; as it was she half filled, and everything
inside&mdash;provisions, clothes, instruments, guns, and
ammunition&mdash;was thoroughly saturated. A gold
watch that happened to be in a coat pocket was not
improved by its immersion.</p>

<p>Another source of amusement during our stay in
this harbour was chasing &ldquo;unies,&rdquo; as narwhals are
invariably called by the whalers; but, although a
good deal of patience and perseverance was displayed
in attempts to harpoon them, these qualities were
never rewarded, and the boats always returned unsuccessful
from their pursuit.</p>

<p>Our little check in this harbour produced a slight
despondency in those who, for the previous few days,
had been most sanguine of pushing on. This was
always alluded to in the ward-room as the depression
of the social barometer, and was for the future daily
registered!</p>

<p>On the morning of the 4th of August, a southerly
gale having blown all the previous night, a channel
of open water was visible as far as Cape Sabine.
This was an opportunity not to be lost. Accordingly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
at 4 <span class="scs">A.M.</span>, the anchors were weighed, and, before a
fresh but bitter cold wind, both ships made sail, and
succeeded, after having made so many futile attempts,
in rounding the Cape. Bearing away to the westward
we steered up Hayes Sound, keeping close in to the
land, the grounded icebergs giving us timely notice
of shoal water. At noon, opening a perfectly land-locked
bay, and the ice being so closely packed ahead
as to defy farther progress, the vessels were steered
for the entrance, and we soon found ourselves in a
beautiful inlet enclosed by high land, but bounded on
one side by one of the grandest sights it is possible
to behold: two enormous glaciers coming from different
directions, but converging at their termination.
They reminded us of two huge giants silently attempting
to push and force each other away.</p>

<p>It was indeed a noble sight, and filled us with
impatient curiosity for the moment when we could
land and indulge in a closer inspection.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the anchors were no sooner let go
than several started for the purpose of paying it a
visit. Landing abreast of the ship, we had rather
a rough and tumble sort of a scramble over loose
masses of gneiss, until we emerged on the banks of
the bed of the glacier&mdash;that is, the bed formed by the
water running from the glacier during the summer
thaws. The walking was most laborious, at one
moment through a wet swampy bog, and at another
over rough sharp-pointed stones.</p>

<p>The vegetation appeared luxuriant, and we found
the traces of musk-oxen, reindeer, wolves, foxes, and
hares in abundance; but, although we were provided
with guns, we failed to secure any game, for the
simple reason that we saw none. But the traces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
musk-oxen were very fresh, and several horns of the
reindeer were picked up. After a tedious walk of
about four or five miles we arrived at the glacier&mdash;the
stupendous and sublime work of ages. How insignificant
and despicable did we appear in comparison
to this gigantic creation of Nature! I can compare
it to nothing except, perhaps, a frozen Niagara! The
left-hand glacier was rounded off, like a huge icy
wave to its end, whilst it receded from our view in
long milky undulations until lost in the clouds. The
right-hand one&mdash;the lateral and terminal sides of
which were quite precipitous&mdash;was pressing against
its neighbour until it had raised a slight ridge between
the two. We were naturally desirous of ascending
one or both of these glaciers, but time would not
admit of such an undertaking, and we were therefore
compelled to content ourselves by standing upon a
small projection of each glacier, so as to be able to say
that we had been on them.</p>

<p>That Eskimos had visited this locality was certain;
for we discovered on our way out the site of an old
settlement, and on the way back we observed two
large cairns that had evidently been used as <i>caches</i>.</p>

<p>Alexandra Bay and Twin Glacier Valley, as they
were henceforth designated, were the nearest approach
to an Arctic paradise that we saw during our sojourn
in the Polar Regions. A sheltered and well-protected
harbour, with a locality abounding in game of various
descriptions, are of such importance that it is impossible
to prize them too highly. They should be
the first and grand objects to be taken into consideration
whilst selecting a spot for winter quarters.</p>

<p>Although we were not fortunate in obtaining game
during our stay of only a few hours in this interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
neighbourhood, I have not the slightest doubt that,
had we penetrated a little farther into the interior,
or had we remained here a day or two longer, we
should have been rewarded by an ample supply, the
traces that we observed being both numerous and
recent.</p>

<p>From tidal observations made during our brief stay
in this harbour, we found that the flood tide in Hayes
Sound came from the eastward, but that the ebb
coming from the westward was the strongest. Whether
Hayes Sound was a strait opening out to the westward
or only a deep inlet was, and remains, a matter of
uncertainty.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1e" id="ft1e" href="#fa1e"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The fact of one of these spear-heads being tipped with iron,
although they all bear the semblance of great age, would lead one to
suppose that the tribe by whom it was left must have had some
intercourse with Europeans, unless meteoric iron was used. This
would be a very interesting question to decide.</p>

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> morning following our arrival in Alexandra
Harbour saw us again battling with the ice in Hayes
Sound, having been deluded into leaving our comfortable
snug quarters by the report that the pack
had drifted to the eastward, leaving a navigable
channel extending to the north. The report was
fallacious, but we succeeded in threading our way
to the N.W. for about twenty miles, when both ships
were helplessly beset, with but little hope of extrication
without a shift of wind.</p>

<p>Many broad glaciers were in view, winding their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
long white snaky lengths between the hills, some of
which could be traced into the interior for ten or
twelve miles, or until lost in illimitable space.</p>

<p>In twenty-four hours, the ice slackening enabled us
to bore a way through, eventually emerging into a
broad stream of water. How sudden and wonderful
are the changes in these regions! From being closely
beset, a couple of hours saw us in an apparently open
sea with <i>no ice</i> in sight, and bowling along before a
fresh southerly gale at the rate of seven knots. Social
barometer very high! In the morning not a spoonful
of water to be seen in any direction, in the evening
not a vestige of ice!</p>

<p>Passing close to the western shore we were able
to confirm our views regarding the Henry and Bache
Islands of Hayes. They are undoubtedly connected,
and therefore not islands; but whether they were also
connected with the mainland we were not able to
determine. In all probability the supposed islands
are a peninsula, apparently of sandstone formation
overlying trap, different to the granitic formation of
the southern shore of the strait. The land appeared
quite bare of vegetation, and bore a strong resemblance
to the Silurian limestone formation of the
land about Prince Regent Inlet, showing stratifications
dipping to the northward at an angle of
about 6°.</p>

<p>It does not do to indulge too freely in vain hopes in
these regions. A period of eight hours was sufficient
to cause our hopeful anticipations of a grand run to
the northward to be &ldquo;considerably eased down;&rdquo; for
in that time we were again stopped by the ice, and
compelled to make fast to a floe, until the pack opened
sufficiently to allow us to proceed. During the run we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
passed some very heavy floes&mdash;heavier than anything
we had hitherto met, and quite sufficient in themselves
to crush any unfortunate ship that should
happen to get nipped between two of them.</p>

<p>Off Albert Head great excitement was caused by
the floe, to which both ships were secured, being
driven towards a large grounded iceberg. To be
squeezed between the two would be fatal. Our
destruction seemed inevitable. Yet we on board were
helpless to avert the catastrophe. All that we could
do was to prepare for a severe nip: unship the rudder,
and lift the screw, and having taken every precaution
to ensure the safety of the crew, in the event of the
ship&rsquo;s demolition, we could only look on, and in
silence witness, as we thought, the irresistible and
destroying powers of the Ice-King.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; was at first in the most critical
position, but a slight swerving of the floe relieved her
from any immediate danger, whilst the same movement
of the ice intensified our own.</p>

<p>Nearer and more swiftly were we hurried towards
the grim and motionless berg, up whose sides the
floe, as it came into contact with it, was seen to be
literally walking and forcing its way, crumbling and
falling into shapeless masses at its base.</p>

<p>Escape appeared impossible. It seemed hard at
the very commencement of our voyage thus to lose
our ship, and with it all hopes of success. Suddenly,
when our fate seemed almost decided, the berg turned
slightly, splitting up the floe to which we were secured
and sending us clear. It was a narrow shave, and
although we suffered a slight nip, no material damage
was sustained.</p>

<p>Being myself too fully occupied with the work on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
deck, one of my messmates kindly packed a few of
my valuables together, ready to take away in case of
having to abandon the ship. On going below after
the ship had been secured, I found carefully packed
in a haversack my journals, Bible and Prayer-Book,
a few photographs, and three boxes of sardines!</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that we passed in idleness
those days that we were beset in the ice and unable
to advance. As a rule our time was more fully
occupied then than when we had leads of water in
which we could proceed. Steam had to be kept
ready for any sudden emergency, and a constant
watch had to be kept on every movement of the pack.
Frequently had the ice anchors to be tripped and the
vessel moved, in order to avoid bergs or floes closing
in upon and nipping us. Occasionally, when the
pack opened, or appeared what we called &ldquo;slack,&rdquo;
we would attempt to bore through; but as this
invariably entailed a large consumption of fuel, and
gave very little result, it was not resorted to more
than was absolutely necessary. Every opening in
the ice was taken advantage of, by which we slowly
but surely made progress northwards.</p>

<p>The crow&rsquo;s-nest was never deserted. In it Captain
Nares might almost be said to live, rarely coming on
deck even for his meals; as for a night&rsquo;s rest, such a
thing to him was quite unknown. From the &ldquo;nest&rdquo;
the motions of the ice were closely scrutinized, the
tides and currents were studied, and the influence of
the wind on the pack ascertained. No opportunity
was ever lost, and it was entirely due to this unceasing
watchfulness that the expedition succeeded in
advancing, although it was only inch by inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span></p>

<p>Victoria Head was reached on the morning of the
8th of August, but at the expense of damaged rudder-heads
to both ships, caused by the constant backing
into the ice whilst engaged in charging and breaking
through slight streams that offered impediments to
our advance. A detention here enabled us to pay the
shore a visit. Great difficulty was experienced in
landing on account of the ice-foot adhering to the
land, which resembled a perpendicular frozen wall
rising to the height of about twelve feet. Indeed it
was more overhanging than perpendicular, as the
action of the water had considerably undermined its
base and therefore rendered it almost inaccessible.
By the aid of a long boat-hook staff and some rope
we succeeded in clambering up, at the expense of
bruised hands, the jagged surface of the ice cutting
like penknives. This proceeding was not unattended
by a certain amount of danger, for had the ice given
way we should have been precipitated into the boat,
in which case we should have been extremely lucky to
have escaped without a fractured bone or limb.</p>

<p>The loose and rugged slabs of slaty limestone of
which the hills were composed made the walking very
arduous, added to which a thick fog and snowstorm
that overtook us rendered our climb unprofitable so
far as ascertaining the nature of the ice to seaward
and the prospect of pushing on were concerned. The
steep cliffs surrounding this prominent headland are
wasted and worn by the combined effects of snow and
weather, and present the same &ldquo;battlemented&rdquo; appearance
so common to the Silurian limestone formation
of the cliffs about Prince Regent Inlet and
Lancaster Sound. A few fossils were collected, but,
with the exception of some sprigs of the stunted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
willow and a single tuft of saxifrage, the land was
devoid of all vegetation. Deep ravines stretched
away into the interior, entirely free from both snow
and ice. Traces of former inhabitants were discovered
along the beach, consisting of the site of an Eskimo
settlement and a few small cairns or fox-traps.</p>

<p>Hitherto the traces of these interesting tribes have
been continuous along the western side of Smith
Sound, and tend, in my opinion, to prove conclusively
that the Eskimos were in former days far more
numerous than they are at the present time. What
has become of them? The solution of this important
ethnological question would be of the greatest interest.
Have they gradually died out? or have they migrated
farther south, and are now represented by the &ldquo;Arctic
Highlanders,&rdquo; and by tribes settled on both sides of
Lancaster Sound who are frequently visited by our
whalers?</p>

<p>It is certain that at some remote time there was
a movement of Eskimo tribes from Asia towards
Greenland in these high latitudes, for traces of their
encampments have been found along the shores of
the Parry group from Melville Island to Lancaster
Sound, where they are still living in Dundas Harbour
and in Admiralty Inlet. The late Admiral Sherard
Osborn and my cousin, Mr. Clements Markham, paid
great attention to this subject during the Arctic
Expedition of 1850-51, and prepared a descriptive
list of all the Eskimo vestiges along the whole length
of the Parry group.<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> We now traced similar remains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
up the western side of the channels leading north from
Smith Sound, at Cape Sabine, on the shores of
Buchanan Strait, on Norman Lockyer Island, on
Capes Hilgard, Louis Napoleon, Hayes, and Fraser,
at Radmore Harbour, and Bellot Island. The most
northern point where human remains were discovered
was at Cape Beechey, in 81° 54&prime; N. Here our naturalist
found the framework of a large wooden sledge,
a stone lamp, and a snow scraper made of walrus
tusk. Beyond this point there was no sign of any
human being having preceded us. This is the utmost
northern known limit of Eskimo wandering, and here
they appear to have crossed the strait, and to have
made their way southward on the Greenland side.
The most northern permanent human habitation in
the world is now at Etah, near Port Foulke, and,
under present climatic conditions, it would be impossible
even for the Etah Eskimo to exist at Cape
Beechey, in 81° 54&prime; N., whither their ancestors must
have wandered in remote times. There is much yet
to learn respecting these marvellous wanderings along
the Arctic shores; and our expedition has certainly
thrown considerable new light on the question. We
have fixed the most northern limit of the Eskimo
migrations, and have established the fact that they
did not come from the north down Smith Sound, but
merely wandered round its shores until the palæocrystic
floes in Robeson Channel made them despair
of finding there the means of supporting life. We
have also proved that the people seen by Captain
Clavering on the east coast of Greenland in 1823
could not have come round its northern extreme, but
that they had found their way to the neighbourhood
of the Pendulum Islands from Cape Farewell. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
are useful contributions towards the final solution
of a very important ethnological question, which,
however, cannot be fully and conclusively settled until
all the unknown parts of the Polar area have been
explored.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">During</span> the remainder of the navigable season, I
propose to present the narrative of the voyage in the
form of a diary, giving the extracts as they were
written down at the time, when the events they
record were fresh in my memory.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, August 8th.</i>&mdash;Snow fell very heavily during
the forenoon, completely covering the surrounding
hills, and lying several inches deep on our deck.
Clearing up in the afternoon we found ourselves
completely beset by the ice and drifting shorewards.
Steam was resorted to and every effort made to reach
a narrow lane of water, only a hundred yards distant,
but without success. At four o&rsquo;clock the ship experienced
a slight nip, the ice piling up as high as
our main chains, but fortunately for us it was of too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
soft a nature to do much damage. Half an hour
afterwards the nip eased and the pack commenced
to open, showing broad lanes of water. This sudden
slackening of the ice was due to the total cessation
of wind. We soon extricated ourselves from our
unpleasant situation, and lay in eager readiness to
take advantage of any opportunity of advancing that
might offer itself.</p>

<p>11.30 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>&mdash;The ways of ice are indeed inscrutable!
Five hours ago Grinnell Land loomed in the distance,
and we had little prospect of reaching it for some
time. Now we are actually made fast to the land-ice
in Franklin Pierce Bay on the southern shore of
Grinnell Land!</p>

<p>We esteem ourselves particularly fortunate in
having reached thus far. Cape Fraser is not far
distant, and this appears to be our Rubicon. Once
passed, fewer difficulties are anticipated. We may
very fairly reason that to the northward of this promontory
will be found a &ldquo;North Water&rdquo; similar to
the one north of Baffin Bay, the ice remaining in the
broad part of Smith Sound like the middle pack in
Baffin Bay and Davis Straits.</p>

<p>In the latitude of Cape Fraser Kane reported what
he called an open Polar Sea, Hayes the same, whilst
the &ldquo;Polaris&rdquo; actually navigated for some distance
this &ldquo;North Water.&rdquo; Why-should we find it different?</p>

<p>The ice opened this afternoon in a miraculous
manner, in one long lead from land to land, sufficiently
wide for us to pass through; and then, as if
it had opened expressly for us, closed again, and with
such rapidity that our consort, who was following in
our wake, having lagged a little behind, was caught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
and remained beset for some time; eventually, however,
boring through and rejoining us.</p>

<p><i>August 9th.</i>&mdash;We succeeded this morning in pushing
on for three or four miles, when, being completely
stopped by the ice, we were again compelled to make
fast. In consequence of the heavy fall of snow
yesterday, the surface of the water was coated with
a soft sludgy substance, half ice and half snow, which
greatly impeded our progress.</p>

<p>The statement made by Dr. Hayes in his interesting
work, that &ldquo;along the entire coast of Grinnell
Land no glacier appears,&rdquo; is slightly inaccurate; for at
the head of Franklin Pierce Bay two tolerably large
glaciers are situated, whilst another was seen a few
miles to the westward on the same coast. Doubtless
Dr. Hayes intended to say <i>discharging</i> glaciers, in
which case he would, I think, be nearly correct.</p>

<p>For three days were we detained, without the ice
allowing us the slightest chance of moving, during
which time a complete series of magnetic observations
was obtained on the floe, the inclination of the needle
being as much as 85° 34&prime;. Both the dredge and trawl
were also put into requisition and with good results.
Amongst the many zoological curiosities brought to the
surface, from a depth of fifteen fathoms, were some
crinoids. These echinoderms are very rare, few
specimens having been met with, until the deep-sea
dredgings of the &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; brought them more
into notice.</p>

<p>A small island, since called Norman Lockyer
Island after the distinguished astronomer of that
name, was visited, and its highest eminence ascended
for the purpose of watching the movements of the
pack. Landing on the ice-foot that fringed the shore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
we stepped on to a long shaly beach that rose in well-defined
and regular terraces to at least two hundred
feet above the level of the sea, showing the different
tidal marks, and illustrating clearly the gradual upheaval
of the land. Numerous traces of Eskimo were
discovered on this small and remote island, consisting
of the sites of several encampments, and a bone
harpoon point, all apparently of very ancient date.
The highest part of the island is from five to six
hundred feet above the sea. It is of limestone
formation, and on several of the rocks, especially
those at its summit, distinct glacial marks were
detected. Vegetation was scanty, although here and
there the poppy, saxifrage, and willow could be seen
cropping up between the stones.</p>

<p>Here too we succeeded in harpooning a couple of
walruses. Three of these large animals were observed
on a piece of ice, their large ungainly forms stretched
out, lazily enjoying their <i>siesta</i>. Volunteers were not
wanting for the purpose of attempting their capture;
but as an indiscriminate attack would only lead to
failure, it was determined to despatch one of the
whale boats, specially fitted with a harpoon gun, and
all the necessary implements and gear for securing
these animals, in order to effect in a more organized
and skilful manner the object we had in view.</p>

<p>Great difficulty was experienced in approaching
our prey, as the boat had to be hauled over loose
fragments of ice, and pushed through a sludgy consistency
of soft ice, snow, and water, in which the
oars were useless; so that it was feared the unavoidable
noise would disturb and frighten them away.
At length, after much trouble and no little exertion,
we succeeded in getting within about eight yards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
so sound was their repose, without exciting any suspicion
in their minds that danger was lurking in their
vicinity. At that distance, however, they evinced a
degree of restlessness, by lifting their shaggy heads
and uttering jerky spasmodic snorts, that showed us
only too plainly a retreat was meditated.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:797px; height:428px" src="images/img99.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">WALRUSES.</td></tr></table>

<p>Selecting the largest of the three as his victim,
our harpooner carefully laid his gun. A moment of
breathless suspense followed, to be relieved by the
report of the gun, a roar of pain and rage, and the
disappearance in the water of the three walruses,
while the piece of ice, on which a moment before they
had been reposing, was covered with blood, convincing
us that our shaft had taken effect. If any further
proof was required in corroboration of this fact, a
tugging at the line and the sudden moving of the
boat was sufficient. Lances and rifles were quickly
seized; for these animals, when wounded and maddened
by pain, are ugly and dangerous customers,
and have frequently been known to rip the planks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
out of a boat with their formidable tusks, and thus
seriously endanger the lives of the crew. We had
not long to wait; a disturbance in the water close
alongside denoted that our victim was coming to the
surface. An instant after, his bearded face with every
expression of infuriated rage and demoniacal hate,
his fiery eyes glaring with vengeance, appeared, and
was immediately saluted with two or three rifle
bullets. This warm reception served only to incense
and irritate him, and he tried hard to wreak his
vengeance on the boat; but his enemies were too
powerful, and with the united aid of bullets and lance
thrusts the unwieldy beast was forced to succumb
to the superior power of his human antagonists.
Towing the great carcase back to the ship, it was
hauled up on the floe, and quickly <i>flinched</i>.<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The
blubber and flesh were packed in barrels, making a
very welcome addition to the small amount of food
that we had on board for our dogs.</p>

<p>Another walrus was harpooned on the following
day, and these were the only two captured by the
expedition during their stay in the Arctic regions.
Walrus steaks, from this date, were for some time in
great demand, whilst the liver was pronounced to be
perfectly excellent, and even superior to pig&rsquo;s fry!</p>

<p>As a rule these animals are exceedingly difficult to
kill, for in addition to their enormously thick skulls
and coating of almost impenetrable skin and blubber,
they are excessively tenacious of life. A rifle bullet,
although a walrus may eventually die of the wound,
is more than useless, as it will effectually scare him
away, and thus all chance of securing him is lost.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>
The only sure way of succeeding in their capture is
by the use of the harpoon, and this weapon of course
is only available at short distances.</p>

<p>During the temporary delays of the ships in the
ice, amusement was not forgotten, and we often had
rare fun. It is a very important point in an Arctic
expedition to keep the men constantly employed and
interested, otherwise they would, more especially
when their onward progress was checked, be subject
to gloomy moods and fits of despondency. Care,
therefore, should be taken to guard against these
feelings.</p>

<p>Amongst the numerous games purchased by the
expedition before leaving England was a football,
which, on occasions of this sort and when the ice
would admit of it, would be produced, and a game
kept up with great spirit, though with an utter disregard
of all orthodox rules. So long as Jack got
his kick, no matter in which direction the ball was
propelled, he was satisfied! Officers and men would
alike mingle in the game, every one determined to
carry out the one grand object, namely, that of enjoying
themselves. Skating and sliding on the ice were
also accomplishments that afforded much pleasure
and amusement, and were freely indulged in by all,
irrespective of age or rank. Sometimes our Eskimo
dogs would be taken out on the floe and harnessed
to an empty sledge, whilst some would-be dog driver,
anxious to attain proficiency as a whip, would make
a start, and be seen tearing round the floe, regardless
of weak ice and pools of water, at the rate of ten
miles an hour, returning on board thoroughly
drenched, but happy in the knowledge that he had
succeeded as a dog driver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span></p>

<p>Perhaps a few words here in connection with the
dogs would not be out of place. As I have before
stated, they lived almost entirely in the fore part of
the vessel, and were consequently especial favourites
with the men, by whom they were fed and greatly
petted. Of course they were all named, their appellations
being more characteristic than euphonious.
They rejoiced in such names as Ginger, so called on
account of his colour; Bruin, because he was minus
a tail, having been deprived of this appendage in his
youthful days; Boss-eye, on account of the obliquity
of his vision, or as our men expressed it, because
&ldquo;his eyes were rove cross-jack brace fashion;&rdquo; Sore-sides,
in consequence of the unfortunate dog when it
came on board suffering from an unhealed wound in
its side. Sallie, Topsy, Sly-boots, Jessie, etc., were
the names of others.</p>

<p>The only English dog in the expedition was my
black retriever Nellie, an old shipmate and companion,
who took no pains to conceal her displeasure
and disgust at the introduction of such, in her estimation,
a rough and rowdy pack; nor was she ever
afterwards induced to cultivate their acquaintance.
As she lived in the after part of the ship, she viewed
with a jealous eye any attempts on the part of the
Eskimo dogs to intrude on what she regarded as her
own domain, and would invariably fly at and drive
them forward.</p>

<p>Shortly after their appearance on board, and long
before they had been used for sledging purposes, a
species of rabies, or dog madness, broke out amongst
them, which very quickly and alarmingly thinned
their number. The first symptom of this disease
would generally be the dog falling down in a fit, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
which it would partially recover only to rush about
in a frantic manner as if totally deprived of all sense
and feeling. On some occasions they would rush into
the water and be drowned, and at other times wander
away from the ship to be no more seen; sometimes
their sufferings would terminate in death, whilst at
other times they would be shot in order to release the
poor things from their pain.</p>

<p>All expeditions have experienced the same kind of
disease and mortality amongst their dogs, for which
there has hitherto been no remedy. It is a curious
fact that hydrophobia is unknown among the Eskimo,
and no man bitten by one of these dogs during a mad
fit has ever suffered permanent injury from its effects.
Frequently whilst employed sledging, they have been
attacked by violent fits, resembling cramp, completely
prostrating them, causing them to roll over on their
sides and foam at the mouth. On these occasions
they would be freed from the sledge, which after a
time they would follow, when they would be reharnessed
and proceed as if nothing had occurred.</p>

<p>Dr. Colan devoted much of his time to the investigation
of the nature and causes of this disease, and
I have no doubt his researches will throw a flood of
light over this matter that will prove of the greatest
value to succeeding expeditions in the preservation
of their dogs, and be the means of baffling the attacks
of this insidious disease.</p>

<p>The dogs when employed in dragging a sledge are
always harnessed in line abreast, and never, as
generally supposed, ahead of each other in tandem
fashion.</p>

<p>From six to ten or a dozen dogs form a team.
They are capable of dragging as much as one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
and fifty pounds per dog; but this is rather an
excessive load and should not be exacted for any
length of time. So strong and enduring are they
that they will frequently perform a journey, over
smooth ice, of twenty-five or thirty miles a day with
this load; but with light loads and level ice they
have been known to travel as much as seventy and
even a hundred miles in one day.</p>

<p>There is something very exhilarating and exciting
about dog sledging, so long as the weather is fine,
temperature not too low, smooth level ice to travel
over, and a light sledge to drag. But let all these
various conditions be reversed, let the weather be
thick and foggy, or a gale of wind blowing with a
blinding snow-drift, a temperature of 50° below zero,
rough hummocky ice to travel over, and a heavily
laden sledge to be dragged by a tired and obstinate
team, then dog sledging cannot be regarded as either
a comfortable or desirable amusement.</p>

<p>The sensation of dashing along on a light sledge at
the rate of ten miles an hour, the fine snow flying
into one&rsquo;s face as the dogs tear through it pell-mell in
their headlong career, or perhaps plunging down the
side of a steep ravine when the utmost caution is
required to prevent the sledge from capsizing and
toppling over on the top of the dogs, is both novel
and delightful. But when obstacles such as hummocks
and deep snow-drifts have to be encountered,
especially with a low temperature, the reverse is the
case. Directly the sledge receives the slightest check
from either of these causes, the dogs lie down, and
look at you in the most provoking manner. It is
no use having recourse to the whip, for not all the
flogging in the world will make them advance until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
the obstacle has been removed, or the sledge carried
over the difficulties that had retarded its progress.</p>

<p>The whip is the main feature in dog driving. To
be a good driver it is therefore necessary to use this
implement in a dexterous manner. The lash is a
thong of sealskin about eighteen or twenty feet long,
attached to a short handle of about twelve inches
in length. It is, in the hands of an experienced
driver, a formidable weapon, the punishment that the
dogs receive from it being often very severe. They
are guided solely by it, and it is amusing to witness
the cunning and intelligence displayed by the outside
dogs, who invariably get more than their fair share
of the lash, in dodging under the lines of the others
and emerging somewhere in the midst of the team in
order to escape from its terrible infliction. Another
very annoying and distressing piece of work connected
with dog sledging is clearing the lines, which in a
short time become in a grievously entangled state
from the constant dodging about of the dogs, and this
it must be remembered has to be done with hands
encased in thick woollen mitts, for to bare them
would ensure serious frost-bites. In consequence
of the amount of provisions that have of necessity
to be carried for the use of the dogs, it is almost
impossible to use them for long journeys. None
were employed during the expedition by any of the
extended sledge parties; but for short journeys, or
when dispatch was required, they were invaluable.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Thursday</span>, <i>August 12th.</i>&mdash;Early this morning, the floes
opening slightly, an attempt was made to proceed;
but it was a futile one, the ice remaining perfectly
impenetrable. This delay is naturally causing anxiety,
as our fuel is rapidly disappearing, from the constant
demand for steam, and the navigable season is also as
rapidly waning, young ice forming alongside the ship
nearly an inch in thickness. Patience, combined with
caution and perseverance, is an indispensable qualification
for an Arctic navigator. At the same time he
must be prepared, when occasion offers, to make a
bold dash. Quick determination and an ever-ready
eye to seize upon any available opportunity are also
necessary attributes of the explorer who hopes to
achieve success in ice navigation. Without them
failure is inevitable.</p>

<p>In the forenoon both ships were slightly nipped.
We succeeded in unshipping our rudder in time; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; receiving the squeeze more astern,
had her rudder very severely injured. She was
enabled, however, to patch it up sufficiently for temporary
use and thus avoid the necessity of shifting it.
In the afternoon the ice began to move to the eastward,
enabling us once more to make a start. Hastily
shipping our rudders we got under weigh, and having
bored through a few streams of ice emerged into a fine
lead of water extending between the land and the
pack. Passing Cape D&rsquo;Urville, we opened a large
inlet. At its head was a deep ravine, containing two
large glaciers which, running respectively from N.E.
and N.W., met and formed one terminal face. At
9 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> the southern extreme of Dobbin Bay, called
Cape Hawks, was passed. This is a magnificent
promontory, which has, with some propriety, been
compared, in appearance, to the Rock of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>It was a beautifully calm night as both ships
silently rounded this bold headland, the water so still
and unruffled that it was actually used as an artificial
horizon for the purpose of taking an astronomical
observation. The Cape itself towered over our heads
as we steamed past, its reflection in the still quiet
water being clearly visible, whilst deep ravines on
either side stretched away apparently for miles into
the interior, until lost amid the snow-shining mountains
in the far distance. A large glacier at the head
of the bay showed out prominently as it glistened in
the light of a bright midnight sun, the bay itself being
covered with an icy sheet, broken only by a few long
low bergs, generated, in all probability, from the selfsame
glacier. The few clouds that were visible in the
almost cloudless sky presented an exquisite iridescence
rarely witnessed, exhibiting clearly defined bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
colours, extending in bands in a horizontal direction,
the reflection of which in the clear pellucid water
materially enhanced the beauties of the landscape.
Such a scene, with all its surroundings, could scarcely
be equalled in beauty, certainly not surpassed, even
in sunny Italy.</p>

<p>Making the ships fast to an iceberg, preparations
for landing a large depôt of provisions, similar to the
one established at the Cary Islands, were immediately
commenced. A jolly-boat, obtained from the &ldquo;Valorous,&rdquo;
was also deposited here. We have now two
large depôts, besides boats, established in our rear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
sufficient to sustain a large party for many days,
should any untoward accident befall our ship.</p>

<p>Whilst engaged in these operations, an adjacent
island&mdash;Washington Irving Island&mdash;was visited, and a
large cairn erected on its summit. Our surprise may
be imagined when, on reaching the top, the remains of
an old cairn were discovered. At first its origin was
attributed to Hayes, who visited the island in 1860,
but on closer inspection evidences of a construction at
a much earlier date were palpable, the stones of which
it was composed being covered with lichen, denoting
great age. Hayes, in the published account of his
voyage, makes no mention either of having seen this
cairn or of having built one on the island. It was,
undoubtedly, the work of white men&rsquo;s hands; the
object and necessity for building cairns is unknown,
and therefore not practised, by the Eskimos. How
then came this structure in such a remote and desolate
part of the world? Can it be the work of some obscure
navigator of years gone by, who erected this monument
as a memento of his visit, but who never
returned to relate the results of his adventurous
voyage? This must for ever remain a mystery!</p>

<p>Of course it was quickly demolished and its site
subjected to a very careful search, in the hopes of discovering
some record or clue by which its history
might be ascertained; but nothing was found, and we
were forced to content ourselves with reconstructing it
on a larger scale, and depositing a record at its base
detailing the movements of the expedition.</p>

<p>The depôt having been landed, the ships were
moved a little farther up the bay, although, to effect
this, we were compelled to have recourse to powder,
in order to &ldquo;blast&rdquo; a passage through the ice. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
recent tracks of a bear were observed on the floe,
being the only indications of the presence of these
animals that we had observed since leaving Melville
Bay. It naturally caused a little excitement amongst
our sportsmen and would-be bear slayers.</p>

<p>The formation of the land around Dobbin Bay
appeared curiously contorted; the stratifications
dipping, in some places, to the westward at an angle
of about 18°, whilst at others they assumed a perfectly
horizontal direction. This irregularity of the strata
may probably be accounted for by the trap, or other
primary rock, forcing its way upwards through the
limestone formation. Where these contortions appear
the colour changes from the sombre grey of the
surrounding limestone to a bright red and brownish
hue.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, it being deemed expedient for the
safety of the ships that they should be docked, the
requisite instructions were given, and in four hours
they were securely placed in two large commodious
docks, cut out of the solid floe.</p>

<p>The process of docking is rendered necessary to
prevent a ship from being crushed between two floes
should she be so unfortunate as to be placed between
them with the whole force of the pack driving against
the outer one. This operation is frequently necessary
whilst following the land-ice, although in these days
of steam it is not so frequently practised as of old.</p>

<p>Our ice-saw crews had previously been organized,
and, as it is absolutely necessary that the work of
construction should be carried out with the utmost
expedition, the whole of the officers and ship&rsquo;s company
were stationed so as to take an active part in the proceedings.
The instant the order was given for &ldquo;all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
hands to cut dock&rdquo; a most animated scene ensued.
Triangles were quickly erected, saws placed in position,
the dock measured and marked out by boarding-pikes
placed at the several corners, and every one
working as if their lives depended upon their own
individual exertions. Three persons only were left on
board the ship&mdash;namely, one officer in charge of the
deck, the engineer at the engines, and a man at the
helm&mdash;and, as it was necessary to keep the ship constantly
moving so as to avoid pieces of ice, and also
to place her in a good position for being docked, these
three had no sinecure offices.</p>

<p>Occasionally a jet of water, followed by a loud
report and a shower of fragmentary ice, showed that
powder was used to shatter the larger pieces of ice that
had been cut, but unless great care is taken in the use
of this explosive, it is liable to damage the sides of
the dock.</p>

<p>This was our first attempt at dock cutting, which
will account for the time occupied in its construction.
Ordinarily the work should be completed in about a
couple of hours. When two or more ships are in company
time is saved by employing all hands to cut one
dock large enough to take in all the ships.</p>

<p>The diagram on next page will serve to illustrate the
system employed by us whilst engaged in making one
of these docks. The last triangular piece of ice that
is taken out&mdash;namely, the portion marked on the plan
by the letters C B F&mdash;is removed intact, and being
placed across the entrance serves to close the dock
and thus keep out all stray pieces of ice.</p>

<p>After four hours of such work as dock cutting
entails, it was poor comfort for us to return on board
wet, cold, and hungry, only to find that our fires had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
been allowed to burn out, and that we could neither
get a cup of tea to refresh ourselves with, nor a chance
of warming ourselves at
the stove.<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The Eskimo
dogs, being turned out
on the floe and tied to
one of our anchor lines,
made night hideous by
their dreary and lamentable
wailing.</p>

<p class="pt2">For two days were
the ships kept close prisoners;
but on Sunday,
August 15th, as soon
as divine service was
finished, a large party
of men was actively
engaged in cutting and
blasting a passage between
the floe in which
we were imprisoned and
the shore, for a lead of
water had been observed
in the channel which we
were naturally desirous
of reaching. Although
Sunday was as much as
possible observed as a
day of rest, it was quite
out of the question to a
party situated as we
were altogether to abstain from work on the Sabbath.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
Our navigable season, we knew, was a short one; no
opportunity could we afford to lose; and therefore we
were compelled to work as much on Sunday as on
week-days should circumstances arise which would
make it necessary for us to do so. After about nine
hours&rsquo; hard work we succeeded in making a passage
sufficiently broad for the ships to pass through. Our
last explosion was a most effective one; no less than
eight blasting charges, or torpedoes, were exploded
simultaneously&mdash;these varied in size from five to
twelve pound charges.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">&ldquo;THE MOANING OF THE TIED.&rdquo;</td></tr></table>

<p>The result of this, designated by the men, &ldquo;feu de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
joy&rdquo; was wonderful; the floe split and cracked in all
directions, enabling us with our long ice points and
poles to clear a splendid channel. Hauling the ships
out of dock, we steamed through the passage and into
a fine stream of water round Cape Louis Napoleon.
So narrow, however, was our channel that in rounding
the point, to our great dismay, the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo;
grounded. A delay at this moment might have proved
fatal to us, and it was therefore with no small amount
of satisfaction, after a short detention, that we observed
her again afloat. Our joy at being again on
the move was short-lived. A few hours sufficed to
bring us to the edge of a field of ice, to penetrate
which seemed utterly impossible. To cut a dock in
such ice, the floes being from ten to twenty feet in
thickness, was also out of the question, even had we
been provided with saws sufficiently long to do so.
Blasting was resorted to, and by this means we were
enabled to secure the ship in a small indentation in
the ice that afforded some slight protection. So high
was the ice that our boats, hanging from the midship
davits on the outside of the ship, had to be turned inboard
to prevent their being crushed. For three days
were we kept in a state of feverish excitement without
being able to make any progress, and yet constantly
moving the ship to avoid destruction from drifting
bergs and closing floes.</p>

<p>The shore was frequently visited, and the heights of
Mount Joy and Cape Hayes ascended; but always the
same scene met our view to northward&mdash;an impassable
plain of ice.</p>

<p>Twice in one day were the ships nearly destroyed.
A large iceberg that was aground close to us, and
therefore protecting us from the pack, suddenly floated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span>
and drifted away. This released a large floe to which
we were secured, and with which we drifted down
rapidly towards another large berg that remained
aground. It was an anxious time for us, for in five
minutes, unless we could move out of the way, we
must be inevitably crushed between the two. All
hands were quickly summoned, a line laid out astern
and made fast to some large hummocks, and by this
we fortunately succeeded in hauling the ship clear;
but only just in time, for as our bowsprit cleared the
berg, the floe came into contact with it with such
irresistible force that hummock was piled upon
hummock in a truly alarming manner. Had we
been caught, nothing short of a miracle could have
saved us.</p>

<p>The noise of the ice as it squeezed against the berg
was anything but pleasant to listen to; but still it
was better than hearing our own timbers crashing to
pieces in the same manner, and we all experienced a
strong feeling of relief when the danger was past.</p>

<p>Little rest was enjoyed by any on these days during
which we were subjected to the wayward will of the
pack. Unshipping and replacing the rudder, and
lifting and lowering the screw, were duties that had
to be carried out several times during each day, and,
although this sort of work is rather depressing and
irksome, the spirits of the crew never flagged. They
were always ready, cheerful, and willing. No matter
what duty they were called upon to perform, it was
invariably carried out in the same zealous, hearty
manner that was so conspicuously manifested during
the whole period of the absence of the expedition as
to elicit the unbounded praise and confidence of their
leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span></p>

<p>On the 19th of August the ice slackened sufficiently
to enable us to proceed, and on that evening, to the
intense delight of every one, we succeeded in rounding
Cape Fraser.</p>

<p>During the last three weeks we had advanced
exactly ninety miles, or at the rate of about four
and a quarter miles a day. This cannot be considered
a rapid rate of travelling, yet to accomplish
even this necessitated a constant and vigilant look-out.</p>

<p>Cape Fraser is a bold promontory some thousand
feet in height, terminating in a short projecting point
of land about two hundred feet above the level of the
sea. Above the talus appeared numerous caves in
the cliffs, a peculiarity noticed for the first time, and
the summit was studded with irregularities that, to
an imaginative mind, might be perverted into gigantic
beings, animals, or castellated towers. On one of
these ridges was a heap of stones supposed to represent
the &ldquo;Twelve Apostles,&rdquo; and was so marked on the
chart; but as we could never distinguish more than
half the number at one time from any point of bearing,
it was generally supposed on board that they adhered
to true man-of-war regulations, and only appeared in
their &ldquo;watch on deck,&rdquo; half the number belonging of
course to the watch below!</p>

<p>At 10 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, being again temporarily stopped, the
ships were secured in a little harbour called Maury
Bay. During our detention in the vicinity of Cape
Fraser, we were able to confirm the observations
made by Dr. Bessels of the &ldquo;Polaris,&rdquo; relative to the
meeting of two tides at or about this point. This
fact materially strengthens the argument in favour
of the insularity of Greenland, for it has been deduced
from a series of tidal observations obtained by us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
that the tide to the northward of Cape Fraser&mdash;that
is, the tide in Kennedy and Robeson Channels&mdash;is
undoubtedly the same as the North Atlantic one, and
therefore flows along the northern coast of Greenland.</p>

<p>Contrary to what might generally be expected, we
did not encounter any very great accumulation of
broken up ice in consequence of the meeting of these
two tides: not more than would be caused by the fact
of the channel decreasing in size to the northward at
this point, and therefore offering greater obstruction
to the ice whilst drifting northward, but facilitating
its general drift, which is to the southward.</p>

<p>From the summit of Cape John Barrow, which
forms one extreme of the little bay in which we
were secured, we obtained a good view, and one
which delighted and gladdened our hearts.</p>

<p>Northwards we could see as far as Cape L. von
Buch; between us leads of water, although covered
with much loose ice. To the eastward we could
plainly distinguish Cape Constitution, with a large
sheet of water along its base; but to get to it we
should have had to penetrate a large expanse of pack.
This pool of water was in all probability similar to
one seen by Morton in the same place in 1855, and
reported by him as an &ldquo;open Polar sea,&rdquo; on which
many imaginative theories have been based!</p>

<p>Our return to the ship was not accomplished without
much difficulty, in consequence of our little harbour
of refuge having filled with drifting ice, during the
time we were on shore, which beset our boat. We
were therefore compelled to haul and drag it over and
through innumerable fragments of ice, reaching the
ship wet and fatigued, but delighted with the intelligence
we possessed and the prospect of pushing on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span></p>

<p><i>Friday, August 20th.</i>&mdash;At one o&rsquo;clock this morning,
being the top of high water, we made another
start.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the different broad lanes of
water, we steamed rapidly past Cape Norton Shaw,
and opened out Scoresby Bay&mdash;a grand harbour that
would suit admirably for a ship&rsquo;s winter quarters,
provided animal life existed. From the appearance
of the land we imagined that game would be found in
large quantities. A perfect cone-shaped hill on the
north-west side is a very prominent feature of this
bay. Indeed, the entire coast along which we are
passing is composed of long ranges of hills more or
less coniform, varying from one to two thousand feet
in height. The coast line is very imperfectly delineated
on our charts, the distance between the various
bays and headlands are erroneous, and the positions
are wrong; the error always being that they are
placed too much to the northward.</p>

<p>Off Cape McClintock we had another narrow escape
from being severely nipped, in consequence of attempting
to pass through a channel between two closing
floes. Although jammed for a short time, the pressure
was not very great, and, the nip easing, the ship was
released. Passing Cape Collinson we were again
obliged to make fast to a large floe, as all the leads
to the northward had closed up, thereby preventing
farther progress.</p>

<p>The ice was moving rapidly to the southward&mdash;the
whole pack drifting bodily&mdash;at the rate of from one
and a half to two knots an hour. The floe to which
we were secured was kept stationary by a couple of
grounded icebergs that effectually resisted all its
efforts to extricate itself. This rapid drift seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
indicate the presence of a &ldquo;North Water,&rdquo; or at any
rate a very loose pack.</p>

<p>Advantage was taken of our temporary delay to
establish a small depôt of provisions, consisting of
two hundred and forty rations, near Cape Collinson,
for the use of a travelling party which, according to
existing arrangements, would be dispatched to the
southward by the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; during the following
year, for the purpose of visiting Cape Isabella, and
bringing up any letters that might have been deposited
there for us.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, August 21st.</i>&mdash;Lanes of water appearing
continuous to the northward, we got under weigh at
half-past two this morning; but after two or three
hours&rsquo; boring and working under steam and sail we
were forced to relinquish the attempt, being unable to
penetrate the pack in the direction we wished to proceed.
We therefore returned to our former anchorage, under
the lea of a friendly berg, the ice continuing to drift
south with marvellous rapidity.</p>

<p>Whilst detained here we were assailed by some
furious squalls from the S.E., accompanied by a
heavy fall of snow. During one of these the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo;
was blown away from her anchors, and it
was with no little difficulty that she was again secured
to the floe in safety. Thinking we should be able to
reach some open water to the northward by the
removal of the large floe to which we were fast, both
ships&rsquo; companies were employed in sawing off a large
piece of it, which, impinging on one of the stranded
icebergs, would, it was thought, release the floe if
detached. The distance to cut through was one
thousand feet. Notwithstanding the magnitude of
the undertaking, every one set to work with a will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
and resolution that betokened confidence in being able
to succeed in anything that was required of them.</p>

<p>Before the work was fairly commenced the ice
appeared to slack to the eastward, and the captain,
abandoning his former intention, determined to seek
a passage through the pack instead of hugging the
coast.</p>

<p>Getting under weigh at 9.30 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, we bored through
a large extent of slack ice, into a fine piece of open
water, which, when reached, we found possessed no
outlet. It was a perfect salt-water lake surrounded
by ice. In this we were obliged to dodge about under
sail, waiting patiently for the ice to open and thus
allow us a free passage.</p>

<p>As we proceed northwards the ice appears to be
heavier and more formidable, and animal life seems
to be getting more scarce. Few birds are seen.
Occasionally the head of an inquisitive seal is protruded
out of the water, but immediately withdrawn
(if not killed) on being saluted by half a dozen bullets
from the rifles of our keen and enthusiastic sportsmen,
who are for ever on the watch to display their prowess
in their endeavours to procure food for our dogs, by
shooting these animals, who thus pay for their curiosity
with their lives.</p>

<p>We appeared to be leaving the region of icebergs, for,
although those met with lately were of great size,
they were few in number. The one affording us
protection this forenoon was no less than six hundred
feet in length.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1h" id="ft1h" href="#fa1h"><span class="fn">1</span></a> An amusing story is related of one of the officers. Whilst engaged
in cutting the dock, he, without thinking, put his pipe in his trousers
pocket, so as to enable him the more readily to work at his ice-saw.
Feeling, after a time, a little warm about his legs, he attributed it to
his exertions in working the saw, until a sharp and intolerable pain
caused him to put his hand into his pocket. This speedily afforded an
explanation: his pipe, being still alight, had burnt a hole through
his trousers and shirt and was burning his leg!</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Sunday</span>, <i>August 22nd.</i>&mdash;The rapidity of the changes
that take place in these icy seas is almost inconceivable.
In a few hours from being helplessly imprisoned
by a dense pack of ice, we were actually
plying, under steam and sail, in a vast expanse of
water containing only a few loose streams of ice,
through which we had no difficulty in penetrating.
Our predictions were indeed realized, and to a greater
extent than we had even anticipated. We had reached
a &ldquo;North Water,&rdquo; in which we were sensible of a very
perceptible motion on board the ship. It is true that
the pack, apparently as solid and as impenetrable as
ever, extended along the west side of Kennedy Channel;
but to the northward and along the east side was a
clear and open sea, free of ice, with its surface agitated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
by the fresh northerly wind that was blowing, and
rising and falling with true oceanic undulations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, at least so far as making
headway was concerned, the wind was not only very
strong but directly ahead, compelling us to beat to
windward under steam and fore and aft sails. We
consoled ourselves, however, with the hope that the
same wind would blow all the ice to the southward,
and thus enable us to make good progress. The
temperature being some six or seven degrees below
freezing point caused us to feel the sharp wind in a
very unpleasant manner, and made both the crow&rsquo;s-nest
and bridge very disagreeable places of resort.
The pleasure of feeling that we were really doing good
work was, however, sufficient compensation for the
discomfort that was felt.</p>

<p>Stretching over to the eastern side of the channel
we passed close to Crozier Island, having Cape Constitution
full in view. Its appearance coincides
exactly with the description given by Morton.</p>

<p>This cape is the northern extreme of a bay called,
by Kane, Lafayette Bay. It is steep and precipitous,
and has no ice-foot adhering. Indeed, the base of
the headland, as well as the adjacent one, Cape
Independence, has the appearance of having been
partially undermined by the action of the sea, thus
forming an overhanging terrace, up which it would be
impossible to ascend. Morton found its ascent totally
impracticable, on account of the steep and rugged
nature of the cliff. We were unable to detect any
signs of a <i>mer de glace</i> over this land, although a
light tinge along the summit to the southward of
Lafayette Bay would lead one to suppose that it
existed. This, however, was the only indication of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
an ice-cap that was perceived, and it was one on
which little or no reliance was placed.</p>

<p>The positions of the various points along this coast
are very fairly correct, being as nearly as possible in
the latitudes ascribed to them by Dr. Bessels of the
&ldquo;Polaris,&rdquo; affording a striking contrast to the places
on the opposite side of the channel, where the positions
are so egregiously inaccurate. The deep inlet on the
American chart called Carl Ritter Bay was not to be
seen. The only indentation in the land in its assigned
position was Richardson Bay, which we must naturally
conclude was the one seen and named Carl Ritter by
Dr. Hayes.</p>

<p>It was a curious fact that, whereas the land on the
west side of the channel was completely covered with
snow, the land on the east side was entirely free.
This was not the only peculiar feature in which the
two sides of the channel differed. Although apparently
of the same geological formation, there was
a great dissimilarity between the physical appearance
of the land on either side. That on the east was flat
and table-topped, rising to the height of about one
thousand feet, separated into hills by broad valleys,
whilst the stratification of the cliffs was regular and
horizontal. That on the west side was, on the contrary,
composed of conical-shaped hills, rising to an
altitude of from two to four thousand feet, and intersected
by deep ravines, whilst the stratifications were
so distorted that the dip varied as much as from 10°
to 45°.</p>

<p>Whilst the land on the east side appeared to have
undergone a regular and steady upheaval, that on the
west seemed to have been raised suddenly, the deep
ravines between the numerous hills resembling the
beds of ancient and extinct glaciers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span></p>

<p><i>Monday, August 23rd.</i>&mdash;A glorious run has been
made during the last twenty-four hours, assisted, for
a short time, as we have been, by a strong southerly
wind; but alas! by 10 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> we arrived at the end of
our tether!</p>

<p>Passing the entrance to Bessels Bay, we reached
Cape Morton, from whence extended right across Hall
Basin our implacable enemy, the ice&mdash;solid floes of
immense area stretching to the northward as far as
the eye could reach, with no opening, no outlet of any
description, and no indications of water.</p>

<p>Polaris Bay was ahead of us, and we could plainly
discern the position of the Americans&rsquo; winter quarters;
but with no hopes, for the present, of our reaching so
far. We must again, as we have so often had to do
before, exercise our patience, and wait for a more
favourable opportunity for pushing on. The strong
southerly wind now blowing will, in all probability,
be succeeded by a calm or a breeze from the northward,
either of which will have the effect of opening
the ice. The &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; having landed a small
depôt of two hundred and forty rations at Cape
Morton, for the use of travelling parties that will
hereafter be dispatched for the purpose of exploring
Petermann Fiord, both ships made sail and beat
back to Bessels Bay, where we dropped anchor in
seven fathoms, just inside, and under the protection
of Hannah Island.</p>

<p>Bessels Bay is a long and narrow indentation in
the land, extending in a N.W. and S.E. direction,
having numerous small glaciers on either side, the
majority of them discharging ones. The bay is in
consequence nearly choked with small bergs.</p>

<p>This bay or fiord gives one the idea of having been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
originally the bed of some large glacier, now extinct,
whilst Hannah Island, which lies directly across its
mouth, has every appearance of having been its
terminal moraine, not only from its position, but also
from its composition, for it consists of an immense
heap of pebbles and drift, possessing apparently no
determined basis, no underlying rock.</p>

<p>We were also able to observe here the undoubted
<i>mer de glace</i> under which Greenland is supposed to be
buried, and whose outpourings in this locality find
their escape in Petermann Fiord and Bessels Bay.</p>

<p>A few eider-ducks, a seal, and some dovekies, with
an ivory gull, were seen to-day.</p>

<p>Captain Feilden and Mr. Parr landed on the
northern side of the bay, and, ascending a high hill,
obtained a good and unobstructed view to the northward.
Their report was very desponding&mdash;ice, nothing
but ice, as far as they could see.</p>

<p>From what we can now observe, the land on the
western side of Hall Basin appears to end abruptly
somewhere about Cape Union, and does not continue
to the northward, as represented in the last American
Chart. I put no belief in the land reported to have
been seen by some of the men of the &ldquo;Polaris,&rdquo; and
named President Land. Should the land terminate,
as I anticipate, in about lat. 83° N. our chance of
reaching a high latitude will of course be much
reduced, although we shall have a grand field of exploration
to the eastward and westward.</p>

<p>In the evening the captain and myself visited
Hannah Island, and erected a cairn, in which a
record detailing our movements was deposited, on its
summit, in the most conspicuous place about the
centre of the island. Here we had an uninterrupted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
view to the northward; but what we saw only confirmed
the report brought on board in the earlier part
of the day. The western side of the channel appeared
free of ice as far as Cape Lieber, and a lane of water
was visible extending from us as far as this cape. By
this stream of water appears our only chance of
getting on.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, August 24th.</i>&mdash;The captain left the ship
early this morning to ascend the hill immediately
above Cape Morton (two thousand feet in height), in
order to ascertain from the nature of the ice what our
prospects of pushing on were likely to be. During
his absence a haul with the dredge was obtained, but
with unimportant results: the continual movement of
icebergs in the bay, all more or less aground, would
hardly admit of much organic life at the bottom.
Fossils abounded in the limestone on shore, and a
large collection of specimens was made.</p>

<p>At noon the captain was observed, in his boat, off
Cape Morton, with the signal flying for the ships &ldquo;to
weigh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His orders were speedily executed; and, having
picked him up, we were soon running quickly across
to the western side. He gave us the very pleasing
information that from the summit of Cape Morton he
had observed a magnificent lead of water along the
west coast, and extending in all probability as far as
Cape Beechey. This was indeed delightful intelligence,
and served to raise the social barometer many
degrees.</p>

<p>Our coal was rapidly diminishing, and we knew
that many more days of steaming such as those we
had lately had would reduce our fuel to such an
extent that we could hope to do little more; for without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
steam a vessel in these latitudes would indeed be
helpless.</p>

<p>11 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>&mdash;Oh, the hopes and disappointments that
we poor Arctic explorers have to endure! First of
all a confiding anticipation in the future makes us
joyous and expectant, and then we are plunged into
the lowest depths of despondency.</p>

<p>Two hours ago we were steaming through a grand
expanse of water, looking forward with confidence to
reaching, in a few hours, Cape Beechey, or perhaps
even Cape Union, both being distinctly visible ahead,
whilst Capes Brevoort, Sumner, and Stanton were in
sight on our starboard bow.</p>

<p>Passing Cape Baird, however, we were again met
by our insatiable enemy, the ice, which defied all our
efforts to penetrate it.</p>

<p>We are now slowly picking our way across Lady
Franklin Strait towards Cape Bellot, in the hope of
being able to reach some place of security where we
can remain patiently until a northerly wind shall have
cleared a passage for us. Whilst crossing Kennedy
Channel we obtained a magnificent view up Petermann
Fiord. It is an extensive opening, with no
land visible at its head. This is a geographical
problem which we hope we shall soon be able to
solve. It is difficult to determine at present whether
Lady Franklin Strait is really a strait or a deep inlet.
We are inclined to the latter belief. This is another
question we hope will soon be satisfactorily settled.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, August 25th.</i>&mdash;At one o&rsquo;clock this morning,
whilst threading our way amongst the ice-floes
that bordered the coast, a herd of musk oxen was
observed browsing quietly on an adjacent hill. Such
an opportunity for obtaining fresh meat was not to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
disregarded. A shooting party was quickly organized,
and, whilst the boats were being prepared and the
hunters getting ready their rifles, the ships were taken
into a beautifully snug and land-locked harbour,
protected at its mouth by a large island, situated on
the northern coast of Lady Franklin Bay.</p>

<p>Here the anchors were let go, and the sportsmen
despatched in quest of the game.</p>

<p>Separating into three distinct parties on landing,
we advanced cautiously towards the spot where they
were last seen grazing, hoping to be able to surround
and capture the entire herd. Not only did we all
enter keenly into the sport, but our mouths watered
at the prospect of again indulging in fresh meat. We
pictured to ourselves smoking-hot beefsteaks and
savoury calf&rsquo;s liver, dainties that we had for some
time been strangers to, being prepared for us after
our return to the ship, never even dreaming of a
chance of returning empty-handed.</p>

<p>The disposition of our force was well calculated, for
the musk oxen being alarmed, in all probability by
the blowing off of steam from one of the ships, started
in full flight in the direction of a deep ravine. Here
they were met by a couple of the hunters, who discharging
their rifles dropped two of the herd. The
remainder turned and dashed up the side of a steep
hill, but only to be met by two more sportsmen, who
made such good use of their time and weapons, that
they succeeded in shooting the remainder, seven in
number.</p>

<p>One of the first brought down was the bull of the
herd, a noble fellow; but so tenacious of life that
several shots had to be expended, at a very short
range, before he bit the dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span></p>

<p>Elated with our success, and having sent back to
the ship for assistance in conveying the meat on board,
we commenced skinning, cleaning, and cutting up the
animals, so as to guard against the possibility of any
delay in doing so being the means of tainting the flesh
with the disagreeable musky odour. This, in consequence
of the scarcity of knives amongst the party,
was a long and tedious process; however, by nine
o&rsquo;clock we had the satisfaction of seeing our &ldquo;morning&rsquo;s
bag&rdquo; safely on board, amounting altogether to
2,124 lbs. of good fresh meat. Not a bad morning&rsquo;s
work!</p>

<tr><td class="caption">MUSK OXEN.</td></tr></table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span></p>

<p>These animals, from peculiarities they possess, are
placed in a genus between the sheep and the ox, and
are called <i>ovibos moschatus</i>. They are only met with
in high latitudes, although traces of them, it is
reported, have been seen as far south as 59° N. lat.,
but they are rarely seen in any numbers lower than
67° N. lat.</p>

<p>They have been seen, and shot, in large numbers,
by the various search expeditions wintering at and
about Melville Island, and they were also obtained
on the opposite side of Kennedy Channel by the
&ldquo;Polaris&rdquo; in 1872. The crew of this latter vessel
succeeded in shooting twenty-six during the twelve
months they passed in this latitude. They are
gregarious, usually wandering in small herds, although
occasionally single specimens are found. The herd
just obtained by us consisted of one old bull and four
old cows, and two young bulls and two young cows.
They subsist on the scant vegetation of these regions&mdash;principally
grasses and lichens&mdash;which they scrape
up from under the snow, when the ground is covered.
They hardly give one the impression of being very
quick and agile, yet they ascend hills and climb over
rocks and rough surfaces with great ease. They are
reputed to be very irascible, and have frequently
been known, when wounded, to attack a hunter and
seriously endanger his life. The horns are very
broad, covering the brow and crown of the head, and
meeting at their base. Our bullets appeared to have
no effect when fired at the head. From the bull we
obtained no less than 385 lbs. of meat!</p>

<p>Finding that the harbour in which the ships were
anchored possessed all the necessary qualifications
for rendering the winter quarters of a vessel in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
Arctic Regions comfortable and secure, Captain Nares
selected this spot as the place in which he would
leave the &ldquo;Discovery.&rdquo; It appeared in every way
adapted for this purpose. A secure harbour, possessing
two narrow entrances, with the water so shallow
as to effectually prevent the larger and heavier pieces
of ice from drifting into it, with a neighbourhood
covered with a more luxuriant and richer vegetation
than had hitherto been seen, and giving evidences
of being well stocked with game&mdash;for, in addition to
the musk oxen, numerous and recent traces of wolves,
foxes, hares, and lemmings had been observed&mdash;the
place seemed especially suited for passing the winter
in; and its selection as the winter quarters of our
consort was never regretted.</p>

<p>We all feel that the navigable season is rapidly
drawing to a close, and that very few more days are
left us. During the last week the temperature has
never been above the freezing point; and the young
ice has been forming to an alarming extent, even at
midday. An advance, if farther advance is to be
made, will be better and more speedily accomplished
with one ship only, than by having two to look after.
The responsibility is lessened, whilst the knowledge
that there is another ship to fall back upon, in case
of accidents, removes all anxiety.</p>

<p>When the decision that the two ships were to part
company was promulgated, it was received with satisfaction,
although we were all sorry to lose the companionship
of our numerous friends. The evening
was spent in an interchange of visits, and many a
sincere and fervent &ldquo;God speed,&rdquo; with a silent but
expressive squeeze of the hand, was exchanged between
the officers and the men of the two Arctic ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span></p>

<p>In order to strengthen our force on board the
&ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; and to have an extra sledge party for the
purpose, if required, of communicating with our
consort, an officer, Lieutenant Rawson, and seven
men were received from the &ldquo;Discovery;&rdquo; the only
thing that we were able to give in exchange being
900 lbs. of the musk oxen just procured&mdash;a by no
means despicable offering!</p>

<p>Everything having been satisfactorily arranged, the
&ldquo;Alert&rdquo; steamed away from Discovery Harbour on
the morning of the 26th, exchanging hearty cheers
with her consort as she passed; she hoisting the
signal &ldquo;May Providence prosper your efforts,&rdquo; to
which we replied &ldquo;Happy Winter;&rdquo; and thus we
separated, happy in the knowledge that a safe refuge
was established in our rear, with the unknown before
us, fervently praying for a successful issue to our
undertaking.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Now</span> that we are pursuing our solitary journey northwards,
we can the more fully realize that our real
work has commenced&mdash;the real work towards the
achievement of that success which we all so ardently
hope will crown our efforts.</p>

<p>Now that we are alone we shall be the more ready
to avail ourselves of every opening in the ice that
may present itself, every little chance that may occur,
which we should be unable to do, if hampered with a
second ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span></p>

<p>We had hardly advanced three miles, in fact were
still just inside the entrance to the harbour, when the
ice, closing in round the point, barred all egress.
In endeavouring to steer clear of these fragments,
the ship grounded on a projecting spit off a small
island, but sustained no injury, floating again immediately
she was lightened. As farther advance was
out of the question, for the present, in consequence
of the pack having drifted in, the vessel was secured
under the lee of a natural breakwater at the entrance
to Discovery Harbour, ready to take advantage of the
first opportunity of making a start that should offer.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Feilden and Rawson, I made an
expedition to Distant Cape, whence we obtained a
good view of Robeson Channel; but it was anything
but an inspiriting one. There appeared to be a
perfect block of heavy ice right across to the Greenland
coast, although a few thin blue lines, denoting
streams of water, could be discerned radiating in
the pack to the eastward, but apparently leading to
nothing.</p>

<p>Some terns, <i>Sterna Arctica</i>, were obtained on a
small island, as also their young and eggs. The
nests were simply little round holes, some in the
snow, having a few small pebbles as a bed. Some
knots, <i>Tringa Canutius</i>, were also obtained; but no
amount of search was successful in discovering either
the egg or the nest of this bird.</p>

<p>A fine sheet of water, situated on the breakwater,
being frozen over, afforded our skaters an opportunity
of indulging in their favourite pastime, and of practising
both the inside and outside edges to their
hearts&rsquo; content.</p>

<p>The following day was also one of enforced idleness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
and no movement could be made with the
ship.</p>

<p>Snow fell heavily, much to our annoyance, as it
prevented us from keeping a perfect watch on the
ice in the channel, in consequence of its density.
The ice was being set up Lady Franklin Bay at a
great pace. Once during the day it appeared inclined
to open and give us a chance of proceeding. The
skaters and sportsmen were hurriedly called on
board; but before steam could be raised the opportunity
was lost. In navigating these waters it is
necessary to be constantly on the alert, and prepared,
at any moment, to take advantage of any chance that
may occur; but with the small quantity of fuel we
have remaining, it is also necessary to economize and
husband that essential aid to advance as much as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
possible; our fires were therefore always kept low,
except when the engines were actually working.</p>

<p>A small fragment of driftwood was picked up on
the island. It resembled some hard wood, but was
so wasted and worn by attrition that it was impossible,
without subjecting it to microscopic examination,
to determine to what species it belonged.</p>

<p>The large island off which we were secured, and
which forms the main protection to Discovery Harbour,
was named Bellot Island, after the distinguished
young French naval officer who lost his life whilst
zealously prosecuting the search for Sir John Franklin
and his ill-fated companions.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, August 28th.</i>&mdash;A thick fog in the morning
effectually frustrated all our hopes of advancing; but
clearing up towards midday, we were rejoiced at seeing
several leads through the ice in the direction of Cape
Beechey.</p>

<p>Steam was quickly raised; but, in attempting to
cant, the ship took the ground, and much to our
chagrin and disappointment remained immovable.
This was indeed tantalizing, as we knew by sad experience
how capricious were the motions of the ice,
and that every moment was of the utmost value to us.</p>

<p>Lightening the ship as much as possible, the rising
tide floated her in about a couple of hours, and at
5 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, having hoisted up all our boats, we were again
able to proceed.</p>

<p>As we rounded the point we hoisted the colours and
dipped them three times as a parting farewell to our
consort, who had just time to whip up the signal
&ldquo;Good luck&rdquo; before we were finally shut out from
each other&rsquo;s view.</p>

<p>Rounding Distant Cape, we found the channel full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
of ice, some of the floes being very massive and of
great extent; but between them existed narrow lanes
of water, in some places choked by loose slack ice,
through which we had little difficulty in penetrating,
although at the expense of our rudder, which was so
severely injured by the heavy nature of the ice as to
be rendered almost useless.</p>

<p>At midnight, when within about a mile of Cape
Beechey, ice was encountered stretching right across
the channel and pressing so tightly in to the land as
to form a dead block to our farther advance. We
had then by estimation reached the 82° parallel of
latitude. This check was a great damper to our
hopes, especially as no bays, or protection of any
description for the ship from the pack, could be found
in our immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>Our only resource was to return a few miles to the
southward and there, in a slight indentation of the
land, affording little or no protection, secure the ship
to an ice floe, and employ ourselves at once with the
rather heavy operations connected with shifting the
rudder. This work was performed in about three
hours. In the mean time, a small herd of musk oxen
having been observed on shore, our sportsmen were
despatched in pursuit, and we soon had the satisfaction
of hearing that they had succeeded in shooting
three, the remainder of the herd having escaped over
the hills. This was a very welcome addition to our
stock of fresh meat. Our mizzen-rigging was now
literally groaning with the amount of meat suspended
there; for, in addition to the recent accumulation of
musk-ox flesh, the remainder of our sheep, some
seven or eight in number, had been slaughtered and
added to the general stock. So hard were the portions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
frozen, that they were very truthfully compared to
the legs of mutton and sides of sheep made of wood
usually seen hanging in the front of a butcher&rsquo;s shop
in a pantomime!</p>

<p>The bay in which we had taken refuge was, in consequence
of the work there performed, named &ldquo;Shift-Rudder
Bay.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Sunday, August 29th.</i>&mdash;At noon we were again under
weigh, Captain Nares having ascended a high hill
during the forenoon, from which he had observed an
opening in the pack by which we might proceed.
Cape Beechey was easily rounded; but, in consequence
of the floes closing into the land, we had
a very narrow escape of being caught whilst going
round Cape Frederick VII., and it was only by
pressing the ship at her utmost speed that we succeeded
in rounding it in safety. Two minutes after
we were round, the floe came into contact with the
high steep side of the cape, crumbling against it and
piling up hummock on hummock from the irresistible
force of the outside pressure. What would have been
the fate of our poor little frail ship had she been
caught between these two stupendous works of
nature?</p>

<p>The ice had now assumed a totally different character
from any that we had hitherto seen, being
infinitely more massive and heavy. The thickness
was estimated at from eighty to one hundred feet,
whilst the hummocks formed along the shore and
round the edges of the floes were fully twenty-five and
thirty feet in height.</p>

<p>These large hummocks received from us the name
of &ldquo;floe-bergs,&rdquo; the term being intended to convey
the idea of masses of ice more bulky than ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
hummocks, and formed in a different way. Some of
these huge fragments that fringed the coast line were
fully sixty feet in height, yet they were <i>aground</i> in
some ten and twelve fathoms of water! This will
give some idea of the massive nature of the ice with
which we were contending. The region of icebergs, the
creation of land glaciers, had been passed, and in
their place were substituted these floe-bergs, the production
of a floating glacier.</p>

<p>To contend with this massive ice required the
greatest care and judgment, for little respect is shown
to the unfortunate vessel that is exposed to the fatal
embrace of what has been aptly termed by our old
Arctic navigators &ldquo;ye unmercifull yce.&rdquo; Before midnight
the ship was secured to a large floe in Lincoln
Bay, the pack having again closed in to the land,
thereby obstructing our advance.</p>

<p>The positions of the different bays and headlands
on the western side of Robeson Channel we found
strangely at variance with the positions assigned to
them on the latest American chart; indeed, the
shore, as delineated, was quite unrecognizable. The
land on the opposite side of the channel seemed, on
the contrary, to be very accurately laid down.</p>

<p>With the exception of a little lemming (<i>Myodes
torquatus</i>), captured by Captain Nares when he landed
in the morning, a solitary dovekie (<i>Uria grylle</i>),
fluttering about in the ice-encumbered waters, was
the only living thing seen during the day. The first-named
little animal was the first of its species caught
alive, and excited considerable interest, every one
being desirous of obtaining a peep at the diminutive
little quadruped. One man, more fortunate than his
messmates, was literally besieged, by those less lucky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
than himself in seeing the animal, with numerous
questions regarding its appearance. When asked its
colour the man hesitated, finding it difficult to
describe; but suddenly brightening up he said,
&ldquo;Why, <i>lemon</i> colour, of course!&rdquo; an answer that
appeared quite satisfactory, agreeing, as it did, so
well with its name!</p>

<p>These little mouse-like creatures are the smallest,
yet the most numerous and common, of all quadrupeds
in the Arctic regions. They are extremely
pugnacious and fearless, and often attract attention,
when they would otherwise be unobserved, by their
shrill cries of rage at an approaching step. They
hibernate in burrows under the snow, and live during
the summer on the scant vegetation of these regions.
When roasted and served up on toast, like sparrows,
they were found to be excellent eating, although
provokingly small.</p>

<p>On the same hill where the capture of this little
animal was effected, our naturalist picked up a
marine shell (<i>Astarte borealis</i>), about a mile from the
beach, and at least a hundred and fifty feet above the
level of the sea. This shell was in excellent preservation,
the epidermis still adhering, and in a perfect state.</p>

<p>The apparent freshness of this specimen gave rise
to many conjectures regarding the theory of the
upheaval of the land, the evidence pointing conclusively
to its being both recent and rapid. These
regions offer a wide field for the geologist and student
of natural history.</p>

<p><i>Monday, August 30th.</i>&mdash;During the forenoon, there
being no prospect of pushing forward, a large depôt
of provisions, consisting of one thousand rations, was
landed. This depôt was established for the use of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
travelling parties from the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; or from our
own ship should it be determined to despatch any to
the southward. It was not without some difficulty
that the heavy casks were transported from the boats
to a suitable position sufficiently removed from the
encroachments of the pack. Their transit was only
effected by a nautical process known as &ldquo;parbuckling,&rdquo;
by which casks and barrels are either hauled
up or lowered down steep inclines.</p>

<p>On the brow of the hill immediately above the
depôt a large cairn was erected, in which the usual
records were deposited; the provisions themselves
being so placed as to form a very conspicuous landmark
to any ship passing to the northward, or to any
sledge party travelling along the coast line. Whilst
engaged in these operations, the pack was observed
to slacken considerably, several leads of water opening
to the northward, which we fondly hoped would afford
us an easy passage towards the attainment of that
object which was ever uppermost in our thoughts,
and for which we were ready and willing to make any
sacrifice&mdash;the object of exploring the unknown region,
and of reaching a high northern latitude.</p>

<p>Steam was accordingly quickly raised, and another
attempt made to proceed; but alas! having incautiously
been tempted by promising lanes of water
to stray farther from the land than had hitherto been
our custom, we were soon hopelessly beset by very
heavy ice, of at least eighty or one hundred feet in
thickness, and fully ten feet above the surface of the
water. So high was it that our boats, suspended at
the davits, were seriously endangered, and had in
consequence to be &ldquo;turned in&rdquo; to avoid being
crushed altogether. We were, fortunately, surrounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
by loose pieces of broken-off ice, which
acting as cushions between the ship and the more
massive floes, thereby saved the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; from an
unpleasant nip. As there was no saying when we
might be deprived of the friendly aid of these
&ldquo;buffers,&rdquo; by any sudden movement of the pack,
steam was kept ready in both boilers in order that we
might take immediate advantage of any such motion
for the purpose of extricating our vessel from her very
unpleasant and perilous position.</p>

<p>An anxious night was spent by all on board, and
many ineffectual attempts were made to push our
way through cracks in the pack that appeared to be
inclined to open. Sleep was out of the question&mdash;indeed,
was hardly thought of&mdash;every one being prepared,
with his little bag of necessaries, to abandon
the ship when such an order, which seemed inevitable,
should be given.</p>

<p>On the following day, by dint of much labour, a
space was cleared round the stern of the vessel, which
enabled us to ship our rudder, and, the ice having
slackened a little, by constantly steaming ahead and
astern we succeeded in clearing a larger space in
which the ship could be worked, when, boldly attacking
the pack, we forced our way through, and with
relieved minds and thankful hearts extricated ourselves
from our dangerous position, and once more
secured the ship in Lincoln Bay. The time occupied
in steaming through the pack, a distance of about
a mile, was exactly five hours!</p>

<p>The ice was observed to be still tightly packed
against Cape Union, and consequently hindered us
from pushing on.</p>

<p>We had much reason to be grateful for our safe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
deliverance from the pack, for, shortly after our
extrication, a heavy gale sprang up from the S.W.,
the effect of which on the ship, beset in such ponderous
ice, must have been disastrous in the extreme,
and would in all probability have been fatal. Ice
navigators, however, are not, as a rule, prone to
indulge in ideas as to &ldquo;what <i>might</i> have occurred had
this or that happened:&rdquo; their thoughts and minds
must be directed entirely to the present and the
future, only too happy and thankful, as the days go
by, to find they still have their own good vessel to
sustain them, and carry them through another day.
To our engines we owed a deep debt of gratitude, for
without the powerful aid of steam we should have
been unable, before the gale burst upon us, to have
effected our deliverance.</p>

<p>Towards midnight the gale freshened considerably,
snow fell, and the weather altogether had a very ugly
and threatening appearance. We, however, consoled
ourselves with the hope that it would clear the ice
out of the channel, and thus enable us to proceed.
The noise of the pack grinding and squeezing as it
was tossed about by a short turbulent sea was anything
but pleasing to listen to, resembling in a
measure the sound created by the dashing of the surf
over a rock-bound coast. One can easily imagine
the feelings of those old navigators, in their frail
little barks, which gave rise to the expression that
&ldquo;the irksome noyse of the yce bred strange conceits
among us.&rdquo; Very &ldquo;irksome&rdquo; indeed was that noise
to us, and many were the &ldquo;strange conceits&rdquo; that
we indulged in as we listened to the soughing of the
wind and the crashing of the ice!</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, September 1st</i>, must always be regarded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
at least by all those connected with, or interested in,
Arctic research, as a red-letter day in the annals of
naval enterprise, and indeed in English history, for
on this day a British man-of-war reached a higher
northern latitude than had ever yet been reached
by any ship, and we had the extreme gratification
of hoisting the colours at noon to celebrate the
event.</p>

<p>Never was an ensign hoisted by such a number
of eager and willing hands. All were desirous of
participating in this act, and of sharing the honours
of this important proceeding.</p>

<p>Our success in thus attaining a high position was
due entirely to the S.W. gale, which blew with such
fury, that by nine o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon the pack
was driven so far off the land that a narrow channel
of water was left extending to the northward along
the coast line. We were not long in availing ourselves
of this grand opportunity. The ice anchors
were quickly hauled on board, sail was made, and,
with the steam ready in case it should be required,
we were soon bowling along at the rate of ten knots
an hour, &ldquo;and <i>northwards</i> aye we fled.&rdquo; So far had
the pack been blown off the shore, that the channel
of water was fully three miles in breadth.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the feelings of
those on board the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; at this unexpected piece
of good fortune; for the lateness of the season, combined
with the unprecedented solidity of the ice, had
in a measure damped our ardour and forced us to
realize the apparent hopelessness of attaining, this
year, a high northern latitude. Eagerly and anxiously
were the different reports from the crow&rsquo;s-nest listened
to, and still to the delight of all came down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
cheery words, &ldquo;Water, plenty of water ahead, and no
ice in sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every one was joyous and elated as, at noon, they
assembled round the ward-room table to inaugurate,
in a glass of Madeira, generously supplied by our
wine caterer, the auspicious event, and to wish success
to their flag.</p>

<p>Unfortunately snow was falling heavily, and the
weather was so thick that little could be seen. We
could just make out that the land along which we
were steering, and which trended to the N.E., was
composed of high cliffs with numerous ravines and
valleys running down to the water&rsquo;s edge; but, to
our disappointment, we failed to observe either
harbour or bay, or any place that would afford a
refuge or protection of any description for the ship.
Arctic navigation, like everything else, has its dark
as well as its bright side!</p>

<p>After rounding Cape Union the coast trended away
to the westward of north, and the wind, which had
hitherto been blowing so fresh, suddenly subsided.
So did our joyful anticipations, for one short hour
after our ensign had fluttered out so gaily before the
breeze, we were stopped by a barrier of ice of great
thickness, through which there was no prospect of
penetrating. The land also appeared to lose the bold
rugged character that had been such a prominent
feature between Lincoln Bay and Cape Union, and
now assumed an undulating form as it trended away
to the N.W., the coast being low and entirely covered
with snow.</p>

<p>Having set our minds at rest that a farther
advance, for the present, was perfectly impracticable,
we reluctantly retraced our steps to the southward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
for about a mile, and secured the ship inside a fringe
of grounded floe-bergs that lined the coast and which
promised to afford us protection, in fact, the only
protection, from the irresistible pressure of the pack.
A depôt of provisions, consisting of two thousand
rations, was immediately landed, in order to guard
against all accidents that might happen to the ship,
and also to be of use to our southern travelling
parties, should we succeed in reaching a higher
latitude in the ship. The weather still continued
thick; but during a clear interval we succeeded in
getting a good view to the northward from the summit
of a hill about two hundred and fifty feet above the
level of the sea. But it was a most cheerless scene
that presented itself in that direction. Nothing but
ice, tight and impassable, was to be seen&mdash;a solid
impenetrable mass that no amount of imagination or
theoretical belief could ever twist into an &ldquo;open Polar
Sea&rdquo;!</p>

<p>We were reluctantly compelled to come to the conclusion
that we had in reality arrived on the shore
of the Polar Ocean; a frozen sea, of such a character
as utterly to preclude the possibility of its being
navigated by a ship; a wide expanse of ice and snow,
whose impenetrable fastnesses seemed to defy the puny
efforts of mortal men to invade and expose their
hitherto sealed and hidden mysteries. Still we did
not give up all hope of reaching a higher northern
position in the ship. We knew the wonderful effect
that a gale of wind would produce on the pack,
and we hoped when the weather cleared, we should
still be able to see, and reach, land to the northward.</p>

<p>For the present then we could only put our trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
in Providence, who had already guarded and favoured
us almost beyond our most sanguine expectations,
and pray that He might still continue to watch over
and protect us, and grant us such a measure of success
as would increase our knowledge of this world and
thereby add to His glory.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">In</span> order more effectually to ensure the safety of the
ship, the men were at once employed in removing a
large quantity of loose ice, directly inside the line
of friendly floe-bergs, so as to allow the vessel to be
hauled farther in and thus obtain more complete
protection from the encroachments of the pack. This
was no easy work, for the wind had again sprung up
and blew with terrific violence, whilst the temperature
had fallen as much as ten degrees below the freezing
point.</p>

<p>Before we had succeeded in completing our preparations
a violent squall struck the ship, the lines
by which she was temporarily held parted, and we
were blown clean out from our harbour of refuge.
Steam was instantly raised, and an anchor let go,
which fortunately brought us up. During the succeeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
hours the gale blew with increased fury,
but being an off-shore wind, we were in a measure
protected, whilst it had the effect of driving the pack
off, so as to raise our hopes at the prospect of again
proceeding northward.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without any warning, the wind shifted,
and drove the whole body of the pack towards the
land. Our danger now was imminent. To be caught
between the fast closing ice and the grounded floe-bergs
would be certain destruction, to escape to the
southward before the pack impinged on Cape Union
was quite out of the question, and to steam into the
pack would be madness. Our only hope of safety was
to endeavour to haul the ship inside the grounded
floe-bergs, and again avail ourselves of their friendly
protection. No time was to be lost; it was a case
of almost life and death to us. The men, always
to be depended upon in a crisis like the present, responded
to the call with alacrity, and by dint of hard
work we succeeded in hauling the ship into a safe
position. We were not a moment too soon: it was
a race between the ice and the ship, in which the
latter was, fortunately for us, the victor. Scarcely
had we reached our place of refuge when the pack
came into contact with the bergs, scrunching and
squeezing in a most unpleasant manner as it swept
by, and serving to illustrate, in a very practical way,
the dreadful fate to which we should have been
subjected had we not been fortunate enough to escape
in time.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine a more desolate position
to pass a winter than the one in which we were
placed. Our ship was on an exposed and, apparently,
unsafe coast, without even the protection of a bay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
within one hundred yards of a low undulating beach,
on which, should any extraordinary pressure of the
pack destroy our protecting bergs, we must inevitably
be forced and wrecked, exposed to all the rigours of
an Arctic winter; and yet, notwithstanding these
unenviable drawbacks, the official announcement
that this place had been decided upon as our winter
quarters was received with a deep feeling of relief
and thankfulness. This determination was not, however,
arrived at for some days, when, from careful
watching of the pack, it was decided that a farther
advance was absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>Winter was advancing upon us with rapid strides,
eager to seize us in its icy grasp; so quickly, indeed,
that in two days we were able to <i>walk on shore</i> on
the new and rapidly forming ice. The now steadily
falling temperature was another and a sure indication
that the navigable season was at an end.</p>

<p>Without a harbour or projecting headland of any
description to protect our good ship from the furious
gusts that we must naturally expect, the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo;
lay, apparently, in a vast frozen ocean, having land
on one side, but bounded on the other by the chaotic
and illimitable polar pack.</p>

<p>The land had already assumed a wintry aspect, and
the ship, to be in unison with her surroundings, had
also put on a garb of snow and ice, each spar and
each rope being double its ordinary thickness from
the accumulation of frost rime. Everything was
white, solemn, and motionless around us; no voice
of bird or beast was heard to disturb the silence. All
was as still and silent as the tomb&mdash;a silence that
until then had never been broken by the presence of
man.</p>

<p class="noind">Night, to which we had long been strangers, gradually
came upon us, the darkness increasing perceptibly as
each day passed away. From the 3rd of September,
on which day the sun set at midnight, the days decreased
in length, and the stars were again seen to
twinkle in the heavens.</p>

<p>From a neighbouring hill we obtained a clear and
unobstructed view of our surroundings. The coast
continued to the N.W. in a succession of large bays,
terminating in an abrupt cape some forty miles
distant. In order to assimilate the names of the
various bays and headlands with those of the American
chart, this extreme point was called Cape Joseph
Henry. Beyond Cape Joseph Henry all was conjecture.
It might be the southern extreme of a large
bay or inlet, or it might be the northern termination
of land. No land of any description could be seen
to the northward&mdash;nothing but the rugged pack. So
formidable and compact appeared this icy barrier
that it seemed to stand out bold and resolute in its
strength, effectually setting at defiance the puny
efforts of man to penetrate its solidity, saying, as it
were, &ldquo;Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.&rdquo;
And, indeed, we had much cause to be thankful to
Him who had hitherto watched over and protected
us in many dangers, and who had allowed us to
penetrate thus far into this remote and unknown
portion of the globe.</p>

<p>A long range of high hills could be seen to the
westward, whilst on the opposite side of the channel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
the distant land of Greenland was indistinctly observed,
its most northern point bearing about N.E.
(<i>true</i>).<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>The positions of the northern extremes of land, on
either side of the channel, were, for a time, a matter
of some uncertainty, and it was really doubtful which
was situated in the highest latitude. It was not until
after the return of the autumn sledging parties that
this important question was definitely decided, the
land on the western side proving to be nearest the
Pole.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined, because farther progress
in the ship had ceased, that our labours had in any
way diminished; on the contrary, we felt that our
real work was about to commence: a work in which
we should all share in a greater or less degree, and a
work the achievement of which had been our sole
engrossing thought since leaving England.</p>

<p>Before finally deciding upon the position of our
winter quarters, Captain Nares was desirous of ascertaining
whether a more protected spot could be found
for the ship in the numerous bays to the N.W. than
the exposed position she then occupied.</p>

<p>Accordingly, early on the 5th of September, Aldrich
and myself started away with a couple of sledges, each
drawn by a team of eight dogs, under the guidance of
Frederic the Eskimo, and Petersen, the Danish dog-driver.
Our route lay along the edge of the coast,
where, at times, we were able to take advantage of
the ice-foot on which to travel; but as a rule there
was no continuity of this land-ice, and we were compelled
to strike across an undulating country, deeply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
covered with snow, ascending hills frequently as high
as two and three hundred feet above the level of the
sea, whence we obtained good views of the surrounding
country. The general direction in which we
travelled was N.W., the coast line being a series of
indentations in the land, some of such a size as to
form fine harbours and bays; but, alas! they could
not be utilized for our ship, for they were rendered
unapproachable by a chain of high hummocks extending
in every case across the entrances, whilst the
water in the harbours appeared to be permanently
frozen, and therefore inaccessible for a vessel.</p>

<p>It was a novel sensation to us to be thus dashing
along on our light sledges, exploring a perfectly unknown
country: a wild and barren tract of land, a
snow-covered expanse, receding from our view in long
undulations into the interior, until lost amongst the
high conical-shaped hills of from one to two thousand
feet in height, that invariably form the chief feature
of Arctic scenery in these high latitudes. At noon we
made a brief halt for luncheon, our appetites having
been rendered doubly keen by the sharp cold air of
a temperature some twenty degrees below freezing
point; but which had, until the halt was called, been
unheeded, the constant jumping on and off the sledge
and assisting the dogs over difficulties having kept
us in a perfect glow. Innocently pulling off our
mitts, we commenced a vigorous onslaught upon the
Australian beef with which we had supplied ourselves;
but the first contact of our fingers with the handles of
the knives proved the folly of such a proceeding, and
compelled us again to resume our mitts. These, however,
were now frozen so hard that they were with
difficulty put on! Petersen using a tin cup to drink
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
a little rum mixed with snow, and disregarding his
mitts, burnt his hand rather severely, whilst we were
all obliged to rub the edge of the cup well with our
hands before putting it to our lips!</p>

<p>These little inconveniences were to us a source of
great merriment; in fact, they must really be experienced
before they can be properly and thoroughly
appreciated!</p>

<p>The Eskimo dogs appear to me to be very differently
constituted to their more civilized brethren. In England
a halt for lunch whilst shooting is a signal for all
the dogs to assemble and importune for fragments of
the feast, which they greedily devour. My own dog
&ldquo;Nellie&rdquo; would never be satisfied without obtaining a
very large share of any impromptu meal. With the
Eskimo dogs it is quite different. As soon as the
sledges are halted they lie down and sleep, and rarely
attempt to move until they are required to do so.
Should a piece of meat be thrown to them they may
condescend to swallow it; but they turn up their noses
at a piece of biscuit, utterly despising it as an article
of food. Yet these dogs are excessively voracious, and
always hungry! Nothing in the shape of fresh meat,
or even skin, is safe from their insatiable voracity;
even the thongs that are used for lashing the different
parts of a sledge together, unless they have been well
rubbed over with tar, are unsafe, and will most
assuredly be gnawed off. Notwithstanding this, they
have little liking for cooked meat, positively refuse
biscuit, and are not troublesome when they observe
you eating.</p>

<p>We were <i>en route</i> again directly our luncheon was
consumed, the dogs starting off with renewed vigour
and speed after their short rest, when we came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
suddenly upon a precipitous ravine, almost too late to
stop our team in their headlong career. By springing
out of the sledge and holding on with might and
main, we just succeeded in stopping them in time,
pulling up almost on the very brink of the precipice.
Retracing our steps for a short distance, we left the
hills, and continued our course along the coast line,
until our farther progress was checked by water, a
channel connecting two large bays, which from their
shape afterwards went by the name of Dumb-bell
Bay.</p>

<p>Swimming about in this little sheet of water was a
small flock of eider-ducks, eleven in number, that
appeared to be as much surprised at beholding us as
we were at seeing them. They did not, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
seem disposed to fly away. The only weapon we had
was a rifle with twelve rounds of ammunition. With
this we commenced hostilities, rejoicing in the anticipation
of a fresh-meat meal when we returned to the
ship. So utterly unconcerned did they appear that
we actually succeeded in shooting five before the
remainder took flight; but to our great chagrin we
were unable to possess ourselves of any of our victims,
as they had unfortunately all fallen into the water <i>just</i>
out of our reach. This was very tantalizing, as
neither of us felt inclined to risk being frozen for the
sake even of roast duck by plunging in after them.
We were reluctantly compelled to leave them.
During the following week, however, they were recovered,
having all been frozen together in the water.
With the exception of these birds, no animal life was
seen, although we observed numerous traces of
ptarmigan and lemmings. Tufts of saxifrage and
some grasses were seen, but so thickly was the land
covered with snow that it was impossible to arrive
at any conclusion regarding the vegetation of the
country.</p>

<p>In consequence of the report that we brought back,
Floe-berg Beach was decided upon as the position of
the &ldquo;Alert&rsquo;s&rdquo; winter quarters, and preparations were
immediately made for securing the ship, and for
making as extensive an exploration of the land to the
northward as the duration of light would admit.</p>

<p>The land in our immediate vicinity was also very
naturally an object of special interest to us. Speculations
were rife regarding its extent and formation.
The possibility of obtaining game of any description
was a matter of much importance to us who were
doomed to pass so many months in these icy solitudes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
Alas! any hopes that we had cherished in this
respect were soon found to be fallacious. The land,
for the succeeding eight months, proved to be as
devoid of life as its appearance was sterile and
desolate.</p>

<p>On the 9th of September Aldrich went away with
the dog-sledges, accompanied by two or three of his
messmates, for three days, for the purpose of more
thoroughly exploring the country in the hopes of
obtaining game.</p>

<p>On the 11th I left the ship with Parr and Egerton
and eighteen men, with the object of advancing a
couple of boats to the northward along the proposed
route of exploration. It was thought that they might
prove useful during the future sledging operations of
the expedition. We came back in four days, having
successfully accomplished our mission.</p>

<p>On our return journey we encountered a furious
gale of wind, which broke up the ice along the coast
line, and forced us to drag our sledges over the hills,
the summits of which were almost bare, the force of
the gale having blown the snow completely off. Any
one who has ever attempted to drag a sledge over
a rough stony road will know the severe toil and
labour that is required to be exerted in order to make
any progress. Crossing a bay we made a short halt
for luncheon on the ice, under the lee of a high
hummock, and narrowly escaped destruction from
having selected such a spot for a halt. Without our
observing it, the ice began breaking up, and it was
only by strenuous exertions that we succeeded in
reaching the shore in safety, whence we observed the
ice on which we had recently been encamped drifting
in small fragments to seaward. If this disruption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
had not been observed in time, nothing short of a
miracle could have saved us.</p>

<p>The violence of the gale was so terrific that pebbles
and shingle were blown along by its force, mercilessly
striking our faces and causing acute pain. Still we
had to struggle onwards, for there was no possible lee
under which we could pitch our tents and obtain shelter.
An attempt to do so was unsuccessful, and had to be
abandoned.</p>

<p>One of the men, failing from sheer exhaustion, had
to be carried on the sledge. This seriously added to
our difficulties, for it increased the load which the
wearied sledgers had to drag, whilst it diminished the
power of the draggers. But the indomitable spirit
and pluck of the British sailor overcame all obstacles,
and after an arduous march of eighteen hours in the
face of a furious hurricane, we arrived, to our no
small relief, alongside the &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo; Never was a
goal attained with more pleasure and satisfaction than
was our Arctic home reached that night by the fatigued
and half-blinded sledge travellers. Untrained as they
were, this forced march had seriously overtaxed their
strength and entailed much suffering. Some few
were, on their return, placed under the doctor&rsquo;s
hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile those remaining on board the ship, but
few in number, spent an anxious and trying time.</p>

<p>The young ice, by which the ship was surrounded,
had been completely broken up by the fury of the
gale, and had disappeared; and had it not been for
the protecting grounded floe-bergs, small mercy would
have been shown to the good ship &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; by &ldquo;ye
thick-ribbed ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Small fragments of the pack, large enough, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
to be unpleasant and disagreeable neighbours,
would occasionally find their way between the floe-bergs,
and drift about in our immediate vicinity.
These it was our object to secure as speedily as
possible, otherwise their incessant movement backwards
and forwards with the tide would break up the
young ice, or even prevent it from forming. The
ominous grinding noise of the pack, as it swayed to
and fro in the channel, and the terrible war that
appeared to be raging between the floes as they came
into furious contact with each other, pulverizing their
sides or rending huge fragments from their edges,
was a sound and sight that struck us with wonder
and awe.</p>

<p>The grandeur and solemnity of the scene gave rise
to thoughts of our own weakness and insignificance
amidst these wonders of the far north.</p>

<p>On the morning after our return on board, the
wind having subsided considerably, and a large
channel of water existing between the land and the
pack, Captain Nares determined upon seeking more
secure and sheltered winter quarters in one of the
numerous bays immediately to the northward of our
present position, in the hope that the gale would have
broken up the ice and so afforded us an entrance.</p>

<p>Steam was quickly raised and the rudder shipped;
but from some, at that time, unknown cause we were
unable to lower the screw into its place, or rather to
enter the shaft. Our chance therefore of getting
away was lost, as before midnight the gale was
blowing as furiously as ever. The following day,
however, the weather again cleared up, and renewed
attempts were made to ship the screw, but always
without success. Whilst so engaged a shift of wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
occurred, and we had the mortification of seeing the
whole body of the pack close the channel of water
and resume its place along the coast, where it remained
during the entire winter, effectually sealing us
up. We had good reason to be thankful to our screw
for causing our detention, for a subsequent examination
of the coast proved only too plainly that the
ice had not been broken up and blown out of any of
the harbours that we should have sought, and that
we should not have found any better sheltered
position than the one we then occupied. In all
probability we should have been caught by the fast
closing ice&mdash;an occurrence rather unpleasant even to
speculate upon. We afterwards discovered the reason
for the failure of our attempts to ship the screw. On
lowering it into the water, the ice formed so quickly
in the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; that it effectually prevented the shaft
from entering!</p>

<p>The ship was now secured by lines to the floe-bergs,
and by anchors and cables to the shore, until
she should be permanently frozen in.</p>

<p>We also busily engaged ourselves in making the
necessary preparations for the autumn sledging operations.
Travelling garments were issued, tents
thoroughly overhauled, and sledges prepared.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of September Aldrich was despatched
with three men and two dog-sledges, provisioned for
fourteen days, as a sort of pioneering expedition; his
orders being to proceed, if possible, as far as Cape
Joseph Henry, there to erect a cairn and deposit a
record with full information regarding the practicability
of travelling, that would be of use to the main
party which would follow him in a few days.</p>

<p>By the 25th the ice had again formed around the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
ship, and was of sufficient thickness to bear heavy
weights. This was the day selected for the departure
of the sledging parties. The force consisted of three
eight-men sledges, officered by Parr and May, the
whole under my command. My sledge was named
the &ldquo;Marco Polo;&rdquo; Parr&rsquo;s, the &ldquo;Victoria;&rdquo; and
May&rsquo;s, the &ldquo;Hercules.&rdquo; My orders were to advance
as far to the northward, along the land, as possible,
and at our extreme position to establish a large depôt
of provisions in readiness for the use of the main
exploring parties that would be despatched in that
direction during the ensuing spring. Our provisions
were all carefully weighed and packed; the maximum
weight dragged by each man on leaving the ship was
201 lbs., decreasing at the rate of 3 lbs. per diem due
to the consumption of provisions. The slight experience
that we obtained during the previous few
days&rsquo; sledging stood us now in good stead; the men
who had recently been so employed being regarded as
veterans in sledge work by those who were for the
first time being initiated into its mysteries. All
started in the very best spirits, animated by the same
desire to do their utmost, and to achieve, so far as in
them lay, success and honour for the expedition.</p>

<p>The details connected with the sledging operations
must have a chapter to themselves. I make no
apology for not entering more fully into the journeys
performed by Aldrich and others, as the description of
one sledging expedition suffices for all, and I am,
of course, best able to describe those in which I was
myself personally engaged.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">There</span> are, I am sure, many among those &ldquo;who stay
at home at ease&rdquo; who have little or no idea of what
sledge travelling in the Arctic Regions is like, and
who even fail to realize that it entails hard work of
any description.</p>

<p>Their imaginations picture the travellers seated on
sledges, comfortably wrapped up in shawls and furs,
and drawn by a team of dogs or reindeer gaily
caparisoned, with their bells jingling as they dash
along at a rapid pace over a smooth plain of snow
and ice. They imagine that after the toil of the day
is over a large fire is built up, and, having obtained
some salmon, venison, or other product of the chase,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
a sumptuous meal is cooked and discussed, after
which the sledge travellers compose themselves to
sleep in a nice warm snow-house or wooden hut
constructed by their attendants. All this sounds
very delightful, and is, to my personal knowledge,
believed to be a fairly true picture of Arctic life by
a large majority of people. Unfortunately it is the
very reverse of sledge life on the shores of the Polar
Ocean. Let us see what it is like in reality. There,
great climatic hardships have to be endured, combined
with physical labour of no ordinary description.
No change or variety of any sort can be made in the
fare, nor can more than a certain allowance be
allotted to each individual. When that is consumed,
hunger must be borne with patience until the time
has arrived for the next meal, for until that is due
nothing is obtainable.</p>

<p>For shelter at night time, a tent made of the very
lightest material (for economy of weight is the most
important point to be considered in sledge travelling)
is all the covering to protect the travellers from the
furious onslaughts of a biting wind, always accompanied
by a blinding snow-drift. So searching is the
latter that in spite of all efforts it will penetrate
through every little orifice into the tent, covering
everything inside with a layer of minute snow crystals,
and rendering an uncomfortable night still more comfortless
and disagreeable. Rolled up in their bags,
with the hard frozen sea as their couch, affording
little rest to their aching and frost-bitten limbs, the
wearied sledgers vainly attempt in sleep to become
oblivious to the present. As for a fire by which
circulation might be restored in their numbed extremities,
that is quite out of the question. A limited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span>
amount of spirits of wine, barely sufficient to cook
the allowance of provisions, is all the fuel with which
they are supplied. Even if the material for making
a fire, such as driftwood, was available, it would be
impossible to benefit by it, for it could not be lighted
in the tent, whilst outside, under such circumstances
as I have related, it would be impracticable.</p>

<p>This is a slight sketch of what has to be endured
by the Polar sledge traveller; but a cheerful spirit,
a contented mind, and an ardent desire to achieve
success are quite sufficient to enable him to withstand
the attendant hardships, and even to laugh at and
treat them with contempt.</p>

<p>I cannot do better than quote the words of Sir
George Nares, who, addressing our men before leaving
England, whilst explaining to them the nature
of the work that they were about to engage in, and
speaking from his own personal previous experience
of sledge life, said, &ldquo;That if they could imagine the
hardest work they had ever been called upon to
perform in their lives intensified to the utmost degree,
it would only be as child&rsquo;s play in comparison with
the work they would have to perform whilst sledging!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These prophetic words were fully realized, and were
often recalled and commented on by the men during
their initiation into the work of sledging.</p>

<p>The autumn sledge travelling has been alluded to
by a very distinguished and successful explorer in the
Arctic Regions, as &ldquo;the very acme of discomfort.&rdquo;
In the accuracy of this statement we, one and all,
fully concurred.</p>

<p>The principal reasons that sledging at this period
of the year is more disagreeable than in the spring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
are, first, because the rapidly decreasing light caused
by the sun&rsquo;s altitude lessening day by day is decidedly
opposed to either work or comfort. Before our return
from sledging, the sun had illumined for the last
time, until its reappearance the following year, the
summits of the snow-covered hills in the vicinity of
the &ldquo;Alert&rsquo;s&rdquo; winter quarters, and had sunk, slowly
and majestically, beneath the southern horizon, bequeathing
to us only for a short time a few bright
rays until the long polar night wrapped us in its
sombre mantle, and enveloped us in gloom and
obscurity for many months.</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis gone, that bright and orbèd blaze,</p>
<p class="i05">Fast fading from our wistful gaze;</p>
<p class="i05">Yon mantling cloud has hid from sight</p>
<p class="i05">The last faint pulse of quivering light.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>A few hours of twilight, therefore, were all we had
in which to work. Candles we had none. Our
breakfast before we started in the morning and our
supper after we halted in the evening had to be
discussed in gloomy darkness. Our notes had to be
written in our journals before entering the tent, even
at the risk of frost-bitten fingers.</p>

<p>In the second place, at this time of the year the
ice, over which the sledges have to be dragged, is of
very recent formation, and is consequently weak and
dangerous. The travellers are therefore more liable
to immersion by breaking through the thin ice at this
period of the season than they are during the
spring, or indeed at any other time. Young, and
therefore smooth and level ice, covered with a
treacherous layer of snow, often entices the unwary to
turn from the rougher but stronger floes to travel on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
its flat plain surface. An immersion is invariably
the result. Sometimes the leading men on the drag-ropes
break through this weak ice first, and, by so
doing, time is given to stop and save the sledge; but
very often the ice directly under the sledge gives way
without previous warning, when every effort must be
at once directed to save the sledge. Although this is
always successful it is generally at the expense of the
greater part of the biscuit, which is so saturated with
salt water as to be uneatable, and the wetting, and
the consequent freezing, of the tent with all its appurtenances.
Nothing more wretched and miserable can
be conceived than having to pass the night in a stiffly
frozen sleeping bag, inside a tent, which at the best
of times is barely large enough to accommodate the
party of men for whom it is allotted, but which has
been considerably shrunk by being frozen. Not the
least unpleasant part is the process of pitching it,
for having become as hard as a piece of board, it is
with great difficulty unfolded; more especially as this
operation has to be performed after the fatigues of a
hard day&rsquo;s sledging, by wearied men, in such a temperature
that it is impossible to expose the hands bare
to the cold, and it must therefore be carried out with
mittens on.</p>

<p>The constant wetting of the feet also renders the
men more liable to frost-bites; whilst the heavy
fall of snow, usually experienced in these regions
during the autumn, renders the work ten times more
arduous. For the air thus becomes so thick that it
is impossible to see many yards ahead, and we
have to trust solely to a compass as a guide. We
might, in truth, fairly quote the lines from Spenser&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Faërie Queene,&rdquo; at the heading of the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
chapter, as illustrating our difficulties in this respect&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;That all things one, and one as nothing was,</p>
<p class="i05">And this great universe seemed one confused mass.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>And lastly this continual breaking through the ice
of both men and sledge, combined with the heavy
and incessant fall of snow, renders the task of walking
and dragging a sledge one of extreme labour and
anxiety. These were the little difficulties we had to
experience during our novitiate in this autumn sledge
travelling, and they must be generally expected by
explorers who go away so late in the year.</p>

<p>In a future chapter I propose to give a full account
of the routine of sledge life, of the equipment and
scale of provisions, and of all other details connected
with sledging operations in the Arctic Regions. I
will now, therefore, proceed at once to give a brief
account of our journey, for the purpose of laying out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
a depôt in the autumn, which occupied three weeks of
very severe and harassing work.</p>

<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock, on the 25th of September, the three
officers commanding sledges, myself and Lieutenants
Parr and May, assembled at breakfast in sledging
costume, and a rattling good breakfast our caterer
gave us. At 8.15 our standards were displayed on
the sledges, the ship hoisting the ensign. At 8.30
the crews took up their stations alongside their respective
sledges, and the order was given to march.
Our men stepped out bravely, and as they did so
three hearty cheers resounded from the ship. I
called a halt and returned the salute with as much
emphasis as twenty-four powerful pairs of lungs could
give, and then continued the march. The young ice
seemed strong enough to bear, so leaving the ice foot,
on which the travelling was heavy, we ventured on
the new ice. But we had not gone more than a mile
when, to my horror, Parr&rsquo;s sledge, the &ldquo;Victoria,&rdquo;
went through! It was a case of all hands to the
rescue, and after fifteen minutes of hard tugging and
hauling we succeeded in dragging it upon a firm piece
of ice. But everything was thoroughly saturated.
There was nothing for it but to send back at once for
another sledge and dry things. This being done, we
again proceeded for about three miles, when suddenly
I heard a crack, and looking round, there was my
sledge through! We dragged it on shore, and unpacking
at once, I was glad to find that we had
suffered less than the &ldquo;Victoria;&rdquo; but it was bad
enough. Our tent and gear at the top were of course
saturated, and nearly all our biscuit spoilt. However,
I did not think it advisable to return, so re-packing
we made another start, and shortly afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
were rejoined by Parr. After marching for twelve
miles I halted for the night with the temperature 3°
below zero, the tent frozen hard and shrunk considerably.
Next day we marched thirteen miles over ice
whose blue uneven surface was as smooth as glass,
making it very hard work for the men, who were
sorely put to it to maintain their footing. They
worked splendidly, trudging merrily along, making
light of the heavy loads and the treacherous ice,
thinking only of performing a good day&rsquo;s work, and of
advancing the depôt as far north as possible.</p>

<p>On the third day, being unable to round a point of
land owing to several lanes of water, we were obliged
to unload the sledges and carry the things piecemeal
across a neck of land about two miles in width and a
hundred feet above the level of the sea. On the same
evening snow began to fall, and from that time it
fell incessantly until our return to the ship, increasing
in depth day by day. This, combined with the softness
of the snow as it fell, seriously impeded our
advance, and we were frequently obliged to halt our
sledges whilst the men were employed clearing a road
with the shovels. So impervious was the air, owing
to the heavy fall of snow, that it was only occasionally
that we were able to obtain glimpses of the land as
we journeyed onwards, rendering it most difficult to
make out its conformation, or even the direction in
which the coast line trended.</p>

<p>From the unaccustomed work of dragging, the
shoulders of the men began to evince symptoms of
rawness, although they constantly shifted their drag
belts from one shoulder to the other. In spite of
these little drawbacks, and the dull overcast weather
that generally prevailed, the spirits of the men never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
flagged, and every night the labour of the day would
be forgotten, and singing and laughter would be the
only sounds heard issuing from our little camp, long
after we had comfortably settled ourselves in our
sleeping bags.</p>

<p>It was amusing to listen to the quaint remarks and
witty conversation of the men, as, reclining in their
bags and smoking their pipes, they would, regardless
of the generally dreaded presence of the commander,
broach lower deck topics, and freely discuss and
criticize them. I was much surprised at the extensive
Arctic knowledge which they possessed, showing
that they had read largely on this subject, and were
anxious to learn yet more.</p>

<p>I must own that the subject of eating and drinking
monopolized a very large share of the conversation;
nor did they only occupy our minds whilst awake, for
they frequently formed the subject of our dreams.
On one occasion when I aroused the men in the
morning one of them said, &ldquo;Oh! I am sorry you
called me so soon, sir, for I was dreaming that I was
eating plum pudding, and if you had let me finish
it would have been as good as a breakfast to me!&rdquo;
Gales of wind were, of course, serious impediments
to our advance, and were of not unfrequent occurrence.
They invariably necessitated a halt, as, irrespective
of the cold wind being productive of frost-bites,
it was almost impossible to make way through the
blinding snow-drift, which did not admit of anything
being seen even at the distance of a yard or two!</p>

<p>On the 4th of October, half our provisions being
consumed, and there being the prospect of very heavy
travelling before us on our homeward journey, it was
decided to return. The depôt was therefore established,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>
on the brow of a ridge just above our encampment.
It consisted of 870 lbs. of pemmican and
240 lbs. of bacon. May and myself pushed on, with
the object of reaching Cape Joseph Henry; but the
weather was too thick to obtain any view, and, for the
same reason, it was impossible to ascertain the trend
of the coast or the nature of the travelling to the
northward. The floes seemed to be composed of very
heavy ice, and the hummocks were piled up to a great
height along the coast, especially off any projecting
points of land. Lieutenant Aldrich had, however,
ascended a hill some two thousand feet in height, and
was fortunate in having a fine clear day. From Cape
Joseph Henry the land, he saw, trended away to the
westward, but there was no indication of anything
but the impenetrable polar pack to the north. We
reached a latitude of about 82° 50&prime; N. before turning
our steps homewards.</p>

<p>On the return journey the dragging became infinitely
more irksome and laborious. The snow had
accumulated to such a depth as to render some of the
ravines and promontories almost impassable, being
above the men&rsquo;s knees nearly all the time. On one
occasion we were compelled to take our sledges up a
range of hills two hundred and fifty feet above the
level of the sea, in order to pass a precipitous cliff, off
which was a stream of water, and then to lower them
down a steep incline on the opposite side. To add to
our difficulties, a sudden fall of temperature produced
many severe frost-bites, principally on the feet and
toes. Circulation was always restored as speedily as
possible by the application of the warm hand, and
the injured part was then dressed with glycerine
ointment and lint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span></p>

<p>The hills, over which we were obliged to take our
sledges, subsequently went by the name of the &ldquo;Frost-bite
Range,&rdquo; in consequence of the many casualties
sustained during the time we were on them.</p>

<p>On the 9th the temperature was 15° below zero,
and the boots, stockings, and foot wrappers were
frozen to the men&rsquo;s feet. On coming down the hills
the sledges had literally to be lowered to the ice-foot
from a height of two hundred and fifty feet, at a very
steep angle. Thence it was necessary to follow the
shore, where enormous hummocks of ice were piled
up, having huge cracks and fissures, into which we
sunk to our necks in snow. In crossing some sludgy
ice between the hummocks, on the 11th, Lieutenant
May unfortunately went through, and was so severely
frost-bitten that he eventually had to suffer amputation
of one of his great toes.</p>

<p>The sun set at about one in the afternoon. A
glorious sight: the colours of the sunrise and sunset
seeming to be blended together. This was on Tuesday,
and at breakfast on the following Friday all the
provisions would be expended. The 13th was the last
day of the sun&rsquo;s appearance.</p>

<p>On the 14th the temperature was down to 25°
below zero, and the travelling very heavy; but our
sufferings were nearly over. At seven we sighted the
ship, and hoisted our sledge standards. All the
officers and ship&rsquo;s company came out to meet and
help us, and by 8.50 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> we were on board.</p>

<p>Some of the frost-bites were so severe as to render
amputation necessary. This arose from the difficulty
of finding out the injury in time. A frost-bite steals
upon one like a thief in the night, and before the
victim is aware it often happens that mortification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
has set in. No less than half the party were placed
on the sick list from being more or less severely frost-bitten.</p>

<p>It was a very great relief and comfort to us to be
again on board, and extremely gratifying to receive
such a welcome as that extended to us by our messmates.
They were already feeling a little anxious
at our prolonged absence, knowing that we were only
provisioned for twenty days, and fearing that our
return journey would be greatly delayed by the late
excessive fall of snow.</p>

<p>How comfortable the ward-room looked, with the
lamps burning brightly, a cheerful fire blazing in the
stove, and, what delighted us almost still more, a
clean white cloth spread upon the table, and on it
a sumptuous repast, made doubly inviting by a couple
of decanters of madeira and port! These little comforts
and luxuries, though they may appear to casual
readers unimportant and insignificant, are thoroughly
enjoyed and appreciated by wearied and foot-sore
travellers who have been strangers to light, comfort,
and a good meal, though only for three short weeks.
The pleasure of a warm bath and the enjoyment of
brushing one&rsquo;s hair are beyond all description! We
were all a little thinner when we returned; but, with
the exception of the frost-bites, none the worse for our
expedition.</p>

<p>So far as the results were concerned we were quite
satisfied, considering them perfectly successful.</p>

<p>We had established a depôt of provisions some forty
miles to the northward of the ship, which would very
materially assist the sledging campaign of the ensuing
spring. A large amount of thorough practical
experience had been gained, which we hoped would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
bear good fruit in the coming year. And we had
succeeded in reaching and passing the highest latitude
attained, to the northward of Spitzbergen, by
that distinguished Arctic navigator, Sir Edward Parry,
forty-eight years before, during his memorable journey
over the frozen sea towards the North Pole.</p>

<p>These were the most important results gained by
the autumn sledging.</p>

<p>The disappearance of the sun before our return
necessarily prevented a more protracted exploration
being made. As it was we only had sufficient light
during midday for a very few hours&rsquo; work.</p>

<p>Perhaps, as it was our first experience in sledging,
it was as well we were not able to remain absent for
a greater length of time. As an instance of the
manner in which the different articles increased in
weight during the autumn travelling, we found on our
return to the ship that the tent which had previously
weighed 32 lbs. had increased to 55 lbs., the coverlet
from 21 lbs. to 48 lbs., the lower robe from 18 lbs. to
40 lbs., the floor-cloth from 11 lbs. to 29 lbs., and
everything else in proportion! This increase is due
to the absorption of all moisture, which instantly
freezes. In the spring, although the temperature is
far lower, this moisture, even when frozen, is extracted
by exposure to the sun. In the autumn this is impossible,
as the sun has disappeared.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> sledge travellers having all returned, the necessary
preparations for passing the winter were immediately
taken in hand.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the loss of the sun, which took its
final departure on the 11th of October, we had for
many days sufficient light, during five or six hours of
the day, to enable us to carry out the manifold duties
connected with the preparations for a winter in the
Arctic Regions.</p>

<p>Although the ship was completely frozen in, and
the ice in which she was imprisoned was increasing
in thickness day by day, additional precautions for
her safety were taken by burying a couple of the
largest anchors on shore, and freezing them into
their holes by pouring water over them; to these
were attached the chain cables. These we felt would
be a perfect security for us against any off-shore gale.</p>

<p>Provisions in large quantities were landed as a precaution,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
in case any unforeseen event should, during
the winter, cause the destruction of our ship, and so
at one fell swoop deprive us both of home and supplies.
Out of the casks and cases so landed a spacious
house was constructed, capable, if necessary, of affording
accommodation to our entire party. This house,
which went by the name of &ldquo;Markham Hall,&rdquo; was
used as a receptacle for sails, rope, sledge gear, and
all articles that could not be conveniently stowed
under hatches on board. Its dimensions were forty-nine
feet long, by twelve feet wide, and ten feet high.
The mainsail was used to roof it over. It was altogether
a very grand edifice, and we were, and I think
with some reason, very proud at the result of our
architectural skill.</p>

<p>The building mania seemed to be very prevalent
amongst the officers, the majority of whom employed
themselves in constructing snow-houses for various
purposes near the ship. One officer went so far as to
commence a <i>colonnade</i>, reaching from the shore to
the ship, the pillars to be made of frozen blocks of
snow, but the undertaking was of too gigantic a nature
to be carried out with any hope of success, and was
abandoned after a few days&rsquo; work.</p>

<p>A wooden observatory, brought out from England
for the express purpose, was set up for the transit
instrument, and this with a house adjoining, in which
was placed the alt-azimuth instrument, being the
head-quarters of our astronomical observers, Parr
and May, went by the name of &ldquo;Greenwich.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pt2">Snow-houses were constructed on shore for the
several magnetic instruments, and these latter were
securely fixed by being firmly frozen on snow pedestals.
The three houses in which the instruments
were placed were connected, one with the other, by
sub-glacial passages, one being no less than a hundred
and twenty feet in length. The whole establishment,
which was most complete and reflected great credit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
on its architect, was called &ldquo;Kew.&rdquo; Giffard and
myself were the two officers entrusted with the charge
of the magnetic observations, and many a cold and
comfortless hour had we to spend, in our endeavours
to add to the slight knowledge we possess in this
interesting branch of science.</p>

<p>Several other snow-houses were built for various
purposes. One was for the reception of our powder,
as it is most important that such a dangerous and
combustible article should be removed from the ship,
where of necessity so many fires have to be kept up.
The place in which the powder was stored was called
&ldquo;Woolwich.&rdquo; Others were constructed in which were
deposited all our salt beef for present use, and these
buildings, of course, went by the name of &ldquo;Deptford,&rdquo;
after our great naval victualling depôt in England.</p>

<p>Altogether the neighbourhood of our winter quarters
had the appearance of a young thriving settlement
rapidly springing into maturity, rendering what
would otherwise have been a barren and desolate
scene, one of cheerful life and activity.</p>

<p>The salt beef, which was exceptionally tough and
salt, more so indeed than the ordinary salt &ldquo;junk&rdquo;
used in the navy, was kept in a snow-house; because
we found, by experiment, that it was rendered more
palatable by so doing. In all probability the process
of congelation tended to extract, or precipitate, a very
large portion of the saline matter with which it was
impregnated, and thus deprived it, to some extent, of
its hardness and saltness.</p>

<p>By the 26th of October the ship was completely
&ldquo;housed&rdquo; in by a set of awnings, extending from the
after part of the top-gallant forecastle to the mizzen-mast.
This &ldquo;housing&rdquo; was made of a material
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
called tilt cloth, similar to that used to cover waggons
in England. It was spread on spars lashed between
the masts, having curtains on each side so fitted that
they could readily and easily be triced up when required
for purposes of ventilation. Hanging lamps
were suspended from the spars over the centre of the
deck, which were kept alight night and day. The
funnel, which was provided with a hinge, was lowered
down, and formed a famous and convenient stow-hole
for rope. The number of coils that were deposited
in it was truly marvellous.</p>

<p>Two gangways were cut in the ship&rsquo;s side: the one
on the port side being used as the general one for
entrance and exit; the one on the starboard for carrying
out all slops and dirt to a large dirt-heap established
between the hummocks, some hundred yards
from the ship. A smaller dirt-heap was temporarily
used nearer the ship, the accumulations being removed
to the larger one once or twice a week.</p>

<p>Although, as a rule, the snow was not well adapted
for building purposes on account of its consistency,
we were able to supply ourselves with blocks from
certain places where the snow had drifted in large
quantities and hardened by pressure.</p>

<p>A snow wall, constructed from solid blocks obtained
from these quarries, was formed round the ship at
about six feet distance, and at the height of about
four feet. When this was completed the space between
the ship&rsquo;s side and this wall was filled in with
snow, reaching as high as the fore and main channels,
forming a perfectly solid and impervious embankment
that would effectually aid in preserving the warmth of
the ship. The upper deck was cleared of all superfluous
articles, and was covered with snow about
twelve inches deep. A layer of gravel and ashes was
strewn over the surface; but I am not sure that we
benefited much by this measure, for it was rendered
so slippery by being frozen that it was by no means
an easy matter to walk on it.</p>

<p>All skylights and hatchways were carefully covered
up, two only of the latter being kept open as a means
of ingress and egress. These were so constructed
with porches and double doors as to prevent the admission
of the outside air. The doors, being fitted
with weights, were made self-shutting, so that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
closing of one door was insured before the opening of
the other. Snow walls were also built up round the
porches, and in fact round the hatchways and skylights
not in use, so as to render them all the more
impervious to the cold air.</p>

<p>Round the funnel of the galley fire there was a
large space, inclosed by a wall of snow, in which was
deposited every morning a supply of ice or frozen
snow, to be converted into water sufficient to last
twenty-four hours. The ice for this purpose was procured
from a large floe about one hundred and fifty
yards from the ship, which in all probability was
formed by the thawing and subsequent re-freezing of
the snow on its surface. When it was difficult to find
work for the men to do outside the ship during the
winter, they were employed in conveying this ice to a
large depôt that was formed close to the vessel, protected
from the Eskimo dogs by a snow wall, from
which during gales of wind or other bad weather we
were able to supply ourselves.</p>

<p>Our boats were all hauled up in a safe position on
shore. Sails were left bent, but securely furled and
covered. Ropes that were not unrove were carefully
hauled taut, so as to prevent our being kept awake
during a gale of wind by an uninterrupted &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s
tattoo&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the continual flapping of a rope
against a spar, which produces a very aggravating
and monotonous sound.</p>

<p>Former expeditions were supplied with Sylvester&rsquo;s
warming apparatus, which, by means of pipes leading
along the whole length of the ship, warmed the
&ldquo;between decks&rdquo; with hot air. The only means for
heating the vessel at our disposal were by stoves.
These were placed in various parts of the ship, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
put under the charge of men who were periodically
selected for this service. Stringent regulations were
issued regarding the economical consumption of fuel,
and also to guard against all accidents from fire.</p>

<p>As it is necessary in all ships wintering in the
Arctic Regions to devote a certain place to the washing
and drying of clothes in which a high temperature
can be constantly kept, we appointed for this purpose
a compartment on the fore part of the lower deck,
commonly called the fore-peak. The men had certain
days during the week allotted to them for the use
of this place, and it was found that clothes washed
and hung up one afternoon would be invariably dry
on the following morning.</p>

<p>The vapour arising in this room did not reach the
deck on which the men lived, but was conveyed
through a trap hatch leading into the fore-peak to
a large space under the top-gallant forecastle, inclosed
by a snow wall and made its exit through an up-take
formed of a piece of funnelling. The compartment
was heated by a stove, the fire in which was kept
burning night and day.</p>

<p>The very difficult question of ventilation below was
carefully considered. It is one of the most important
and serious matters that can come under the consideration
of the commander of an Arctic expedition.
Nothing is so essential to the preservation of health
as the pure and free circulation of air on the living
deck.</p>

<p>In this respect we were not so well off as our predecessors,
for they, being supplied with the Sylvester
heating apparatus, were able to admit a more constant
current of air, and thus keep their habitable
deck in a better state and more free from condensation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
than ours. We found it a very difficult matter
to prevent in the slightest degree the accumulation
of moisture on the beams overhead, caused by the
condensation formed by the number of people living
on the deck, and by the vapour arising from the
galley fire. Several up-takes and down-takes were
fitted in holes cut through the upper deck in our
attempts to remedy this serious defect, but as a rule
they had little effect in counteracting it. Men were
incessantly employed during the winter in wiping
the moisture off the beams with cloths. If the hatchway
doors were kept open, even for a short time,
this moisture was at once converted into ice, which,
of course, thawed and dripped immediately as the temperature
was raised. This drip was a constant source
of annoyance to us during the whole winter, and it
was one to which we had, in part, to submit.</p>

<p>Whilst all these necessary preparations for the
safety and warmth of the ship were being carried
out, the comforts of those who were about to brave
the rigours of an Arctic winter were not forgotten.
Warm garments were issued, consisting principally
of a complete suit of seal-skins and warm woollen
guernseys. It must not be supposed that our seal-skins
were of the same material as those soft fur
jackets so much in vogue with the fair ones at home.
Ours were obtained from the ordinary Greenland
seals, whose skins are covered with coarse bristly
hairs. They were, nevertheless, quite as warm, and
were indeed our favourite articles of clothing after
the unpleasant aroma, which seems inseparable from
clothing of this description, had worn off, or until
we had become so accustomed to it as to fail to
notice it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span></p>

<p>Carpet boots, or moccasins made of moose-skin,
were worn on the feet. The former were furnished
with tops, made of duffel, reaching as high as the
knees, and with cork soles over an inch thick. With
any temperature below zero leather boots and shoes
must be discontinued, as they freeze so hard that
the material loses its flexibility, and renders the foot
in consequence more liable to frost-bite. Moccasins,
worn over a couple of pairs of blanket wrappers, and
a pair of thick woollen stockings reaching above the
knee, are undoubtedly the most comfortable foot-gear,
and the best adapted for low temperatures. Blanket
wrappers are, as their name indicates, strips of
blanket, generally about sixteen inches square, worn
folded round the feet in lieu of socks and stockings,
than which they are infinitely warmer.</p>

<p>As a rule, officers and men were dressed alike.
Occasionally some of the former would make their
appearance in long fur coats with hoods that they
had obtained from the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&rsquo;s
store and other places in London, but the majority
adhered to the clothing supplied to them by Government.</p>

<p>A special winter routine was made out, and commenced
shortly after the return of the sledge parties.
It was strictly adhered to through the long winter
night that ensued.</p>

<p>I must not omit to mention the duty of keeping
open the &ldquo;fire hole&rdquo;&mdash;a very necessary and important
precaution, that must be taken, in order to be able
to obtain a supply of water in case of fire breaking
out on board. As a rule, in all ships that have
wintered in the Arctic Regions, the water has frozen
below the suction valves of the pumps, thus rendering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
them totally useless. In order, therefore, to obtain
water, a hole was invariably cut through the ice
near the ship, which was generally placed in charge
of the quarter-master of the watch, whose duty it was
from time to time to clear off the young ice from its
surface, so that at any moment water might be
obtained in buckets. In the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; in consequence
of our valves being much lower, our pumps were
never incapacitated from this cause; still they were
liable to be rendered useless by the water in the
pipes becoming frozen. We therefore always kept
our fire-hole in working order. It was close to the
bow of the vessel, and was inclosed by a snow hut,
so as to guard against the danger of anybody falling
in whilst walking about in the dark. By fixing a
tide-pole in the hole, and by devising a self-registering
apparatus with a line leading from the tide-pole
to the forecastle of the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; we were able to
obtain a very complete and valuable series of tidal
observations. From having the registering-gauge on
board the ship, these observations were continued
uninterruptedly, and were unaffected by gales of wind
or bad weather, that would otherwise have prevented
any one from going outside the vessel in order to
note them.</p>

<p>Thermometric observations were, as may be imagined,
very carefully attended to, and the temperatures
both inside and outside the ship duly registered.
Maximum and minimum thermometers, by which
the greatest heat and the greatest cold for each
consecutive twenty-four hours were recorded, were
established in different places, and were noted every
day at noon by an officer especially appointed for
that duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span></p>

<p>Each compartment in the ship was supplied with
one of these thermometers, and on the living deck
the temperatures at three different heights&mdash;namely,
at the deck, about half-way up, and at the beams&mdash;were
daily registered. For the outside air one of the
ice-saw triangles was erected on the floe, sufficiently
distant from the ship to neutralize any influence that
might be derived from her presence, and on this, at
the height of about twelve feet, were placed several
thermometers. In addition to these, there were other
thermometers on the hill about a quarter of a mile
from the ship, and about one hundred yards above
the level of the sea, so that we were able to obtain a
correct mean of the true temperature of the air. We
were also able to ascertain the temperature of the
snow, and the ground at different depths; and also, by
means of solar radiation thermometers, we succeeded,
on the return of the sun, in getting the temperature
due to its rays at various altitudes.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Sir Edward Parry,</span> during his first and subsequent
winters in the Arctic Regions, fully recognized the
importance of not only exercising and improving the
minds of those under his command, during the long
period of enforced inaction, but also of amusing them,
and letting them feel that they also were assisting in
the amusement of their shipmates. To do this he
instituted an evening school on the lower deck, the
officers acting as teachers; and he established periodicals,
dramatic and other entertainments, in which
he himself joined and took a conspicuous part.</p>

<p>His wise example has been generally followed by
the different expeditions that subsequently wintered
in the Arctic Regions.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, very necessary to exercise both the
physical and mental powers of the men during the dark
months, for when once the ship has been safely
established in winter quarters little work remains to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
be done. The officers are constantly employed in
taking and working up observations in various branches
of science; but the seaman has little to do but reflect
on, and possibly brood over, his situation. It is,
therefore, absolutely essential that some means should
be devised to drive from him all unpleasant thoughts,
and to make him feel that it is in his power to relieve
the tedium of what would otherwise be a long and
monotonous winter.</p>

<p>Each ship had been provided, before leaving
England, with a printing-press, and an officer and
seaman<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> had been instructed in its use.</p>

<p>As soon as it was set up and in working order, the
following prospectus was issued by the &ldquo;firm.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed ptb2">
<p class="center">&ldquo;THE ARCTIC PRINTING OFFICE.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Messrs. Giffard and Symons beg to inform the public that they
have obtained&mdash;at an immense cost and with infinite trouble&mdash;possession
of the extensive premises, lately occupied by Mr. Clements
Markham, situated in Trap Lane, within half a minute&rsquo;s walk of the
foremost Quarter Deck Ladder, and easily accessible to all parts of
the city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have fitted up their new establishment&mdash;<i>regardless of expense</i>&mdash;with
all the <i>latest inventions</i> and <i>newest machinery</i>, to enable
them to carry on the noble art of printing in a style and with a
rapidity hitherto quite unattainable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They therefore expect from the public that support and assistance
which it always gives to the <i>truly deserving</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charges moderate. No credit given. All work required to be
executed to be paid for in advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;N.B. Everything undertaken promptly and correctly executed.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;H.M.S. &lsquo;Alert,&rsquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;July 28, 1875.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The &ldquo;cost&rdquo; and &ldquo;trouble&rdquo; alluded to in this production,
that were expended in obtaining a convenient
place in which to carry out the &ldquo;noble art of printing,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
were caused by the fact that our photographers were
equally anxious, with our printers, to possess themselves
of the small cabin lately occupied by my cousin,
and which is so grandiloquently alluded to as &ldquo;extensive
premises.&rdquo; In fact, for some little time it
was a very sore and vexed question between those two
celebrated and energetic firms. Trap Lane was so
called in consequence of the after-hold being immediately
outside the door of the cabin; and it occasionally
served as a very disagreeable kind of man-trap
when, through inadvertence, the hatch had not been
replaced. As this part of the ship was, during the
early part of her commission, in total darkness, owing
to the piles of stores that were stowed in every available
corner, it is no wonder that unsuspecting individuals
should occasionally have fallen into the trap!</p>

<p>Our printing-press was, it is almost needless to say,
of great use to us during the winter; for, although it
never printed very much for the public service, it was
constantly called into requisition for the purpose of
striking off programmes for our dramatic and other
entertainments; and on such important events as
birthdays and Christmas-day we indulged in the
extravagance of printed bills of fare. On the whole
the printing establishment on board the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo;
tended very materially to beguile the tedium of our
long nights, and must therefore be regarded as a
decided success.</p>

<p>Our school was opened on the 1st of November;
from which date, until the reappearance of the
sun, the attendance was regular and constant. It
was composed of nearly the whole ship&rsquo;s company,
and was divided into classes under the direct superintendence
of the officers. Reading, writing, history,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
arithmetic, and navigation were the principal subjects
in which the pupils were instructed.</p>

<p>The school was held on the lower deck between
eight and nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the classes
occupying the different mess-tables. Only two men
out of the entire ship&rsquo;s company were unable to read
and write, and these two men were placed in a class
with two others, who were unable to read and write
English.<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a> This class was presided over by the
doctor, who kindly volunteered to devote himself to
the instruction of the &ldquo;cripples,&rdquo; as they were facetiously
called.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the improvement which has
taken place in the education of the men belonging
to the Royal Navy during the last half-century, it
may be mentioned that, whereas in Parry&rsquo;s time it
was quite the exception to find a man that could
read or write, with us the exception was entirely
the other way, only two men out of fifty-five being
ignorant of those accomplishments.</p>

<p>Never were seen such painstaking and willing
scholars as our men showed themselves to be. It
is impossible to conceive a more orderly or well-conducted
school, and it was a pleasure to the
masters to devote their time to classes that evinced
such an earnest desire of acquiring knowledge as
did those on board the &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here might be observed a staid old seaman, whose
great brawny hand appeared more suited to grasp
the marline-spike than the pen, vainly endeavouring,
with his elbows squared, his weather-beaten face
close down over his work, and his tongue thrust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
out, to arrive at some satisfactory result in a simple
addition sum. As a contrast to this, at the opposite
table might be seen a smart young sailor, who had
distanced all his competitors in arithmetic, asking
abstruse questions in mensuration of such a nature
as to make even his tutor feel uncomfortable!</p>

<p>After the classes were dismissed, the men enjoyed
an uninterrupted evening to themselves. Games of
various descriptions, such as chess, bagatelle, draughts,
and cribbage, had been purchased for their amusement
before leaving England, and were in constant requisition
during the winter. A large space on the starboard
side of the deck, abaft the living deck, was allotted
to the smokers, and here were held our dramatic and
weekly entertainments on Thursdays. On Sundays
Divine service was performed in the same place.</p>

<p>Books were also a source of great amusement and
interest to many of the men who were studiously
inclined, as the well-thumbed volumes in our library
soon testified. Several men wrote regular journals,
which were even kept up by a few whilst they were
sledging. Amongst the officers, chess, backgammon,
and a rubber in the captain&rsquo;s cabin, formed the
chief amusements. Although gambling is discountenanced
(or ought to be) on board every well-regulated
man of war, we so far forgot ourselves
as to indulge largely in this vice. Seldom was a
game played without a stake on the result! The
stakes, too, were exorbitant, frequently as much as one
lucifer match per game! It must be remembered
that matches were very scarce and precious articles
with us, and it was therefore a very high and
valuable stake. On one occasion, one of my messmates
was so rash as to wager a tallow-candle on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
result of a game; but this was an offer of such
magnitude that no one was sufficiently brave or sporting
to accept it.</p>

<p>Among the many valuable gifts showered upon
us by kind and generous friends at home was an
excellent piano, and fortunately amongst the officers
there was a very talented musician, to whose good
nature and willing efforts to please must be attributed
many a pleasant hour, when our hearts were warmed
by well-known airs bringing back happy home
memories.</p>

<p>Thursday evenings were always devoted to dramatic
entertainments, magic-lantern exhibitions, instructive
lectures, reading, and music both vocal and instrumental.
These entertainments were kept up with
the same spirit, and without a break, during the
whole winter. They went by the name of our
&ldquo;Thursday Pops,&rdquo; and afforded much pleasure and
amusement. They were announced to the general
Arctic public by the following printed notice, which
was widely circulated.</p>

<p>Nearly all the officers took part in these lectures,
and I have not the slightest doubt that all would
have done so had there been any more Thursdays
to spare. They were eagerly listened to by the ship&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
company, and afforded quite as much pleasure as the
readings and songs that followed, in the performance

took part.</p>

SCAMP.&rdquo;</td></tr></table>

<p>The first real dramatic entertainment came off on
the following Thursday. Our plan was for the men
to act one piece and the officers another, and this
was found to work very well. But the rehearsals
were a difficulty, and we were frequently compelled
to shut ourselves up in our own cabins in order to
secure the necessary quiet and privacy to enable us
to become perfect in our different parts.</p>

<p>The costumes were, of course, a subject of much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
discussion and deep interest. The making up of
dresses, and the manufacture of wigs from musk-ox
skins and oakum, sorely taxed our ingenuity and
employed minds and fingers that had hitherto been
strangers to such occupations. Many were the needles
broken, and many were the fingers pricked, before
our ideal costumes were realized. Eiderdown quilts
had to be converted into the robes of a lovely oriental
princess; old uniform coats were beautified with
spangles and tinsel, and appeared as the fashionable
habiliments of a dandy of the seventeenth century;
whilst a wicked magician, of the Hebrew persuasion,
appeared in a coat of unmistakeable clerical cut.</p>

<p>Egerton was an indefatigable stage manager, and
the scenic arrangements under the direction of
Moss, who was also the artist, could not be excelled.
Aldrich at the piano (as our orchestra) was a host
in himself, adding materially to the success of the
entertainments. In fact, officers and men vied with
each other in their endeavours to promote amusement
and hilarity, and if their histrionic abilities were not
of the highest order, the zeal and energy of the actors
fully compensated for this deficiency.</p>

<p>We enjoyed a rare freedom from harsh ill-natured
critics. These pests do not venture across the Arctic
Circle. All who visited the Royal Arctic Theatre
(re-opened after a lapse of twenty-one years) came
with a firm resolve to please or be pleased. Acting
upon this determination, our entertainments were
bound to be successful. The following prologue, composed
for the occasion by Pullen, was spoken at the
opening of our theatre, on Thursday, the 18th of
November, 1875.</p>

<p>All trustful of each other&rsquo;s love, we learn</p>
<p>With steady flame our lamp of Hope to burn;</p>
<p>And suns may set, and twilights disappear&mdash;</p>
<p>They shall not rob us of our Christmas cheer;</p>
<p>Nor blinding drift, nor frozen wave, shall chill</p>
<p>Our laughter glad&mdash;for laugh, brave boys, we will;</p>
<p>Kindling yet once again the genial glow</p>
<p>Of happy English homes on Arctic floe.</p>

<p class="i05 s">&ldquo;Yet once again; for none would here forget</p>
<p>We are but sons of fathers living yet;</p>
<p>In work and play alike, we but renew</p>
<p>The deeds of men who taught us what to do.</p>
<p>And though, more favoured than the rest, we soar</p>
<p>To loftier flights than theirs who went before;</p>
<p>Though ours the boast, by skilful guidance led,</p>
<p>In virgin climes our shifting scene to spread;</p>
<p>We love to read on history&rsquo;s faithful page,</p>
<p>Of ancient triumphs on our Northern stage,</p>
<p>And boldly for our brave forerunners claim</p>
<p>An Arctic &lsquo;cast&rsquo; already known to fame.</p>

<p class="i05 s">&ldquo;Now let the tell-tale curtain rise, and say</p>
<p>What we have done to while your hours away.</p>
<p>Such as we have, we bring you of our best,</p>

<p>One only grief is ours, and you shall share</p>
<p>With us the burden of that gentle care.</p>
<p>One cherished form we miss&mdash;one touch alone&mdash;</p>
<p>One glance of love&mdash;one tender, thrilling tone.</p>

<p>Their thoughts are with us every step we go:</p>
<p>Their life sets northward o&rsquo;er the cold, grey sea:</p>

<p>Under the distinguished patronage of Capt. Nares, the members of
the Arctic Exploring Expedition, and all the nobility and gentry
of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The world-wide reputation of this company is quite unrivalled.
The manager has spared neither trouble nor expense in forming this
company, and has selected none but the very best <i>artistes</i>&mdash;the ladies
being from England&mdash;who, having numerous other engagements, can
remain for a short time only.</p>

<p>The scenic arrangements, under the control and manipulation of
that celebrated artist, Professor Moss, <i>must</i> be acknowledged to be
unparalleled in the experience of ages and of the highest order.</p>

<p>The orchestra, under the management of Signore Aldrichi (lately
from Milan) cannot fail to be appreciated by the audience.</p>

<p>This, the first appearance of the &ldquo;Hyperboreans,&rdquo;
was eminently successful, and elicited both laughter
and applause from our very appreciative and demonstrative
audience. Mademoiselle Blanc (Mr. White)
made a fascinating little Dinah of six feet high,
dressed in a Dolly Varden costume, whilst the other
ladies were all that could be desired, and looked
charming in their gorgeous silk and muslin dresses.</p>

<p>In this respect we had a decided advantage over
our consort, the &ldquo;Discovery;&rdquo; for her space on
board being somewhat limited, the building of an
ice theatre on the floe became necessary. Here,
though the building was spacious and elegant, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
temperature was rarely above zero! The ladies were
therefore unable to indulge in low dresses, and a
close observer might have detected underclothing
composed of seal-skins beneath their otherwise gay
and brilliant costumes.</p>

<p>Occasionally, as the two following bills will show,
we were agreeably surprised by the announcement
of an entire change of programme.</p>

<p>These amusements may be considered light and
frivolous, for men engaged in such a serious undertaking
as that upon which we were embarked; still
they all tended to one point&mdash;namely, the successful
issue of the enterprise. For they kept the minds
of the men employed with pleasant and agreeable
thoughts, drove away all feelings of tedium and
dulness, and thus assisted largely in promoting the

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> sun, as has been mentioned in a previous chapter,
took its final departure on the 11th of October. From
this date darkness gradually settled upon us, reaching
its greatest intensity on the 21st of December. The
type of a leading article in the <i>Times</i> newspaper was
taken by us as a test of the darkness. This was last
read in the open air at midday on the 6th of November,
and then only by a few with a great deal of
difficulty. Many unsuccessful attempts were made
on subsequent days. For a fortnight on either side
of the 21st of December, the difference in the light
between noon and midnight, on a clear day, was
almost imperceptible, on a dull day it was quite inappreciable.
Occasionally, at other times, at midday
a faint luminous band might be observed along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
the southern horizon, but this was all the indication
we had of the difference between day and night.</p>

<p>We did not forget to celebrate on the 21st of October
the Battle of Trafalgar, remembering that our great
naval hero, Nelson,<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> was himself an old Arctic navigator.
Our caterers provided us with a good dinner,
and we were regaled, as a great indulgence on such
an auspicious occasion, with an extra glass of wine!
Two elaborate bills of fare were placed on the table,
on one of which was very creditably sketched the
&ldquo;Alert&rdquo; in winter quarters, and on the other was depicted
the Battle of Trafalgar, with the motto on
each, &ldquo;England expects every man <i>this</i> day to do his
duty!&rdquo; As there was a good dinner on the table,
and the cold weather had made us wondrous hungry,
we all responded nobly to the call!</p>

<p>The 5th of November was another anniversary that
could not pass unnoticed. On that evening the effigy
of Guy Fawkes, ingeniously stuffed with squibs and
seated on a cask well smeared with tar, was duly
paraded round the upper deck, accompanied by the
drums and fifes playing the &ldquo;Rogue&rsquo;s March.&rdquo; It
was then dragged, on a sledge, to the summit of a
neighbouring hummock, and there solemnly burnt in
presence of the whole ship&rsquo;s company. The band
continued to play until the lips and fingers of the
fifers became so frost-bitten that they were compelled
to desist. It was a novel sight to see the dusky
forms of the men, clad in seal-skins, dancing round a
blazing fire on the top of an enormous mass of ice,
whilst in the background was the ship with her masts
and yards thickly coated with snow, and all her ropes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
clearly defined in the bright &ldquo;bonfire light.&rdquo; A
beautiful balloon, manufactured by Moss out of
various coloured tissue-papers, also formed a prominent
feature in the evening&rsquo;s display. Unfortunately,
shortly after it was released, and before it had
ascended to any very great height, it caught fire and
was quickly consumed.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, because I enumerate all
the little incidents connected with the amusements of
the men, that other and more important work was
neglected. On the contrary, the officers were unceasingly
engaged during the winter in taking scientific
observations in their respective departments; each
officer being awarded some special subject. These
included observations in astronomy, magnetism, electricity,
meteorology, tides, spectrum analysis, observations
for the detection of the polarization of light,
chlorine, and specific gravity estimations. The
pursuit of these investigations was at times a matter
of great difficulty and extreme personal discomfort.
It necessitated attendance in, and consequent exposure
to, a temperature many degrees below zero, for several
hours at a time. Under these circumstances it is
no easy matter to handle delicate instruments, the
manipulation of which, even in a temperate climate,
requires the utmost care and caution. Made extremely
brittle by the intense cold, a fall to any of the small
metal movable parts of an instrument, such as the
needles, would be fatal, yet it is almost impossible
to touch them with the uncovered hand. The breath
freezing on the arcs and verniers of the instruments
during the time of observation, and on the glasses of
the telescopes and mirrors, adds seriously to the
difficulty; whilst the unequal contraction of different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
metals during intensely cold weather renders some of
the instruments totally useless.</p>

<p>Paraselenæ, or mock moons, and auroras were of
frequent occurrence, but none of the latter were sufficiently
bright to call for special mention. These
phenomena were always carefully examined, and the
results recorded. As a rule the auroras consisted of
faint coruscations darting across the heavens through
the zenith, frequently in the form of an irregular arch
terminating at each end on the horizon, and generally
accompanied by various small luminous patches.</p>

<p>The lunations of the moon were periods that were
always looked forward to, and gladly welcomed,
affording as they did, on clear bright days, a marked
contrast to the gruesome darkness that generally prevailed.
These clear days were not inappropriately
termed &ldquo;moony&rdquo; ones, and were taken advantage
of to perform all work that was considered necessary
outside the ship.</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Rising in clouded majesty, at length</p>
<p class="i05">The moon unveiled her peerless light</p>
<p class="i05">And o&rsquo;er the dark her silver mantle threw.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>Even on these bright silvery &ldquo;moony&rdquo; days it was
unsafe to venture to any distance from the ship, as
the sudden &ldquo;veiling of her peerless light&rdquo; by fog or
clouds would produce total darkness, and so prevent
the unfortunate wanderer from finding his way back.</p>

<p>Great attention was paid to the important duty of
seeing that a proper amount of exercise was taken
by every soul on board. Open-air exercise was the
more essential to health, because the air we breathed
on board was not as pure as might be desired. This
was inevitable, and the evil could only be partially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
counteracted by strict attention to the enforcing of
outdoor exercise. A walk was constructed along the
floe near the ship, for a distance of half a mile, marked
at every two or three yards by small heaps of empty
preserved meat tins, placed there by our industrious
doctor. We were thus able to take our exercise along
this promenade even on the darkest day, and the
number of times that each individual walked up and
down during the day was proudly recounted at the
dinner-table. The darkness prevented walks to any
greater distance for a considerable time. This then
was our fashionable lounge, and was called the
&ldquo;Ladies&rsquo; Mile&rdquo; after the drive of the same name in
Hyde Park.</p>

<p>Our greatest annoyance was undoubtedly caused by
the incessant drip in our cabins and elsewhere on
board. So bad was it that all books had to be removed
from the shelves, or from any position where
they were in contact with the ship&rsquo;s side or the beams
overhead. Especially over our beds did we suffer,
and could only make certain of a dry night&rsquo;s rest by
taking the precaution of nailing a blanket over the
bed, or sloping one as an awning! No means that
we could devise, although many experiments were
tried on the living deck of the men as well as by the
officers in their cabins, lessened the condensation from
which we suffered, and which increased with any rise
of temperature. One officer went so far as to light,
and keep burning for a whole day, no less than fifty-two
candles and one lamp in his cabin, hoping by
these means to dry it thoroughly; but although it
answered the purpose for a day or two, at an enormous
cost, it was soon as bad as ever. During the time of
his <i>illumination</i> he succeeded in raising the temperature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
of his cabin from 40° to 75°! It is decidedly unpleasant,
whilst writing, to have a continual stream of
water pouring down upon your head and upon your
paper; yet it is impossible to prevent this disagreeable
drip.</p>

<p>One of my messmates, more fortunate than his
brother officers, had brought an umbrella with him,
and this being spread over his chair protected him
from the wet, and thus enabled him to read or write
in comparative comfort, and, what was perhaps of
greater consequence, with the perfect preservation of
his temper.</p>

<p>It may appear like affectation on my part when I
say that any rise of temperature, during the winter,
was viewed by us with dissatisfaction. Clad as we
were to resist a cold of many degrees below zero, we
were made absolutely uncomfortable by the <i>heat</i> when
the thermometer indicated any degree with a + sign.
The only real good that we derived from such a rise
of temperature was that we were able more freely to
throw open the doors leading down to the lower deck,
and thus admit a thorough circulation of fresh air;
on one occasion during the month of November the
temperature rose as high as 23°, and in December it
reached the unprecedented height (for that season of
the year) of 35°! These, of course, were only occasional
jumps, never of long duration, and were apparently
produced by gales of wind from the S.W. Our
experience at the &ldquo;Alert&rsquo;s&rdquo; winter quarters was that
a breeze of wind raised the temperature, and that our
coldest weather was always registered on perfectly still
and clear days! During boisterous tempestuous
weather the pack, although stationary, moaned and
groaned weirdly, as if unhappy gnomes, imprisoned in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
the cold grasp of the frozen sea, were bewailing their
hard fate, and pleading for release from their icy
fetters. The young ice, too, in the vicinity of the ship
cracked in a most alarming manner, each crack being
accompanied by a sharp and loud report, and formed
great fissures, leaving the surface, which had hitherto
been smooth and level, rugged and uneven. Well
might the &ldquo;Ancient Mariner,&rdquo; describing such a
scene, say&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,</p>
<p class="i05">Like noises in a swound.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>This movement of the ice, slight as it was, exposed
the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; to great pressure, and although it did not
amount to an actual &ldquo;nip,&rdquo; nor did it in any way
cause injury to the ship, it made her list over several
degrees. Now, as we in the ward-room were on a
limited allowance of wine, namely two glasses a day,
this heeling over of the vessel caused us great annoyance,
as it prevented our glasses from being filled to
the brim, a custom that had been rigidly followed out
since leaving England. This curtailment of our
&ldquo;rights,&rdquo; as we were pleased to call them, was very
naturally regarded with a certain amount of disfavour.
In order to lessen, if we could not entirely rectify this
evil, we supplied ourselves with ingeniously made
little wedges, which, being placed under the <i>lee</i> side of
the wine-glass, brought it so nearly upright that we
succeeded in very nearly getting our full allowance.</p>

<p>The birthdays of the officers were invariably celebrated
by the best dinners that our indefatigable and
energetic caterers could provide, always having in
view the chance of the ship spending three winters in
the Arctic Regions. As a special indulgence we were
also allowed on these occasions a glass of port wine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
after dinner, a treat that we ordinarily had only twice
a week. The composition of the <i>menus</i> for these
sumptuous feasts was always a subject of anxious
care and forethought on the part of those who were
entrusted with this important duty. Long and
earnest were the consultations that were held, before
one of them was satisfactorily composed and placed
in the printer&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span></p>

<p>As we were living in a land in which little could
be obtained in the way of change, the object was to
diversify as much as possible the names of the same
viands, so as to make the guests believe that the
dinners were entirely different. The names given to
some of the dishes were decidedly original. On the
previous page is the first <i>printed</i> bill of fare that was
placed on the table.</p>

<p>Shortly after the ship had been established in winter
quarters, a careful calculation was made of the amount
of fresh meat we possessed.</p>

<p>By fresh meat, I mean meat of the musk-oxen and
sheep that we had killed, and not the fresh <i>preserved</i>
meat, of which we had an ample supply. It was
found we had sufficient to yield fourteen meals, at the
rate of one pound per man per meal. It was, therefore,
determined to issue a fresh meat meal twice
every three weeks, and, at the doctor&rsquo;s recommendation,
this was done on two consecutive days. In his
opinion this method of apportioning it was the most
conducive to health.</p>

<p>Beer, of which we had been provided with ten hogsheads
specially brewed for us by Allsopp, was issued,
so long as a cask was &ldquo;on tap,&rdquo; twice a week. On
these days half the allowance of spirits only was
served out.</p>

<p>On Sundays Divine service was regularly performed
between decks; the morning and evening services
being read on alternate Sundays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span></p>

<p>Prayers were read daily on the upper deck. The
Holy Communion was celebrated on the first Sunday
in every month. Considering the small number of
men from among whom the choir was selected, and
the necessarily slight amount of practice they could
have, the singing at church was very creditable.
Aldrich played the accompaniment on a harmonium
that we had obtained from the ward-room officers of
the &ldquo;Valorous,&rdquo; before parting company with that ship
at Disco. The credit of originating and instructing
the choir was, of course, due to Pullen and Aldrich.</p>

<p>Medical inspections were held regularly on the first
day of each month, when every officer and man was
minutely questioned and examined. Nothing could
be more satisfactory than the medical report of the
sanitary condition of the men at the conclusion of
these examinations.</p>

<p>The amount of compulsory open-air exercise that
had to be taken by each man was two hours a day;
but most of the men, that is to say all the working
hands exclusive of cooks, stewards, and servants, were
invariably at work, <i>outside</i> the ship, for at least five
hours a day. A very favourite and at the same time
healthy pastime of the men in their leisure hours,
when the moon was up, was that of &ldquo;tabogganing.&rdquo;
This consisted in dragging one of our small satellites
or dog-sledges to the summit of a neighbouring hill,
and then coming down, two or three on the sledge, at
the rate of about sixty or seventy miles an hour!
The men enjoyed this amazingly, and used to race
one sledge against another. As they were not very
expert in the management of these &ldquo;taboggans,&rdquo; and
had little confidence in their own steering, they would,
when they saw there was a chance of their sledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
coming to grief, tumble out and roll for some distance
after it. Fortunately the snow was soft and they
never came to harm.</p>

<p>Rawson, who had acquired a knowledge of this
sport in Canada, was the first to introduce it in the
far north. The dexterity with which he managed his
&ldquo;taboggan&rdquo; was marvellous, and he would frequently,
accompanied by one of his messmates, come down
the steep side of one of the highest floe-bergs in the
vicinity of the ship. Poor &ldquo;Nellie&rdquo; could never
understand whence the motive power of these machines
was derived, and used to rush round barking at us in
a frantic manner when we first started, until left far
behind plunging in the soft snow and struggling to
keep pace with us.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how this dog withstood the cold.
The colder the day the more she appeared to enjoy it,
dashing about in the soft fine snow and picking up
pieces of ice in her mouth for the purpose of having
them thrown for her. It must be remembered that
for any one of us to touch a piece of ice with the uncovered
hand in a temperature 50° below zero would
have been a very serious matter; yet Nellie was able,
in the same temperature, to carry pieces of ice, or
bits of metal or stone, in her mouth for hours together.
The only cause of annoyance to the poor old doggie
was the caking or balling of the snow between her
toes, which used to trouble her a good deal. To
obviate this, four little flannel moccasins were made
for her feet; but, although she enjoyed wearing them
and seemed to be proud of her appearance in them,
they had to be discontinued, as we were afraid that
the tying them on sufficiently tight to prevent their
coming off might stop the circulation of the blood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
and thus produce frost-bite. On the whole, however,
Nellie throve wonderfully well, and until the following
summer enjoyed perfect health. She was my constant
companion wherever I went, attending me during my
walks, and lying curled up at my feet in the observatory
during the long hours that I was employed
taking magnetic observations. She always slept in
an arm-chair in my cabin, being provided with her
own little blanket, on which her name was embroidered.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter it will be as well to
relate an interesting and rather curious incident connected
with one of our Eskimo dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span></p>

<p>In Aldrich&rsquo;s sledge journey to Cape Joseph Henry,
one of his dogs (Sallie), being attacked with a fit, had
to be cast off from the team and was no more seen by
him during that journey.</p>

<p>On crossing the floe with my sledge party about
a week after, we were suddenly joined, to our great
surprise, by an Eskimo dog which the men readily
recognized as Sallie; all our attempts to make her
approach were unsuccessful, although she followed us
at a distance during the day and hovered round our
camp, picking up scraps of pemmican that had been
purposely left out for her during the night. She
eluded all attempts at being caught, running away on
the ice and disappearing amongst the hummocks.
She followed us faithfully, at a distance, until the
day we returned to the ship, when she vanished
altogether. She was last seen on the floe about four
miles from the &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amid the many preparations for the winter, poor
Sallie was forgotten and had almost passed out of
recollection altogether, when one day in December,
more than <i>two</i> months after she had been last seen,
a strange dog was observed hovering round the ship.
This strange dog proved to be the long-lost Sallie!</p>

<p>No amount of coaxing would persuade her to come
near us, and she was eventually driven off by the
other Eskimo dogs, and took refuge on the pack. On
the following day she again made her appearance,
and this time we succeeded in getting her on board
and into a place of safety. She was terribly thin and
emaciated; but being well cared for and attended to,
she rapidly picked up, and was eventually the
strongest and best dog in our whole team.</p>

<p>The question as to how she had existed during her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
long absence from the ship was a difficult one to solve.
At first it was surmised that she had attached herself
to a pack of wolves; but this idea was scouted, as no
tracks had been seen to lead us to believe that these
animals existed in our neighbourhood. It is not
probable that she obtained anything from the ship
during the time she was missing, or that she picked
up scraps from the other dogs, for on her appearance
she was at once driven away by her old companions.
The only probable conclusion that we could arrive at
was that she had supported life by hunting and
feasting on lemmings, for the traces of these little
animals were the only indications that we had of the
existence, outside our own circle, of animal life.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">On</span> the 21st of December the sun reached its greatest
southern declination. We felt on that day that we
had cause for rejoicing. The sun had arrived at the
limit of its southern journey, and now it would, every
day, be travelling to the northward, and therefore in
our direction. So rapidly had the time passed that
Christmas stole upon us unawares, and we were only
reminded of its approach by the strong odour of good
things being cooked that pervaded the whole ship,
bringing to our minds the fact that preparations for
its celebration had actually commenced. Nothing
was omitted that could possibly add to the comfort
and enjoyment of the men on this day. The ship&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
stores were thrown open and they were allowed to
provide themselves with an unlimited amount, so
long as there was no waste, of flour, raisins, sugar,
and preserved fruits, and in addition to the regular
daily allowance of meat, a pound of musk-ox beef and
a pound of mutton were issued to each man. For
the two previous days, during which they had been
disturbed as little as possible, the men were engaged
in making the necessary preparations for spending
their Christmas as happily and as socially as if they
were in a more genial climate. It must be remembered
that this was a day looked forward to by
all, not only in the light of a festival, but because it
was also regarded as the turning-point of the winter.
After Christmas every day would bring us nearer to
the sun, whose bright face we all so ardently wished
to welcome once more. Moreover, Christmas day,
to a community situated as we were, &ldquo;away from the
busy haunts of men,&rdquo; must always be regarded as an
epoch, a day looked forward to, and when passed, a
day from which many events are dated.</p>

<p>In addition to the supplies afforded by the stores of
the ship, we were largely indebted to kind, and in
several instances unknown, friends and well-wishers
to the expedition in England for many little articles
that assisted to amuse our men during this festive
season. Amongst these the kind and generous ladies
of Queenstown must not be forgotten. These ladies
had, previous to our departure from England, formed
themselves into a Committee, and had sent to each
ship a large Christmas-box containing many useful,
and indeed valuable, articles. Each officer received
some little package, personally directed to himself,
and every man was presented with some pretty little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
Christmas-box. Nothing could have been more
happily thought of, and it would have done the fair
donors good could they but have witnessed the pleasure
testified by the recipients at the distribution of
the contents of their case.</p>

<p>I must not omit to mention another Christmas-box,
kindly sent by Mr. Mason, the inventor, I believe,
of &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s Luggage,&rdquo; and containing all sorts
of amusing little articles suitable either for decorating
a table or a Christmas-tree.</p>

<p>Another act of kindness on the part of our friends
in England was also much appreciated by both officers
and men. A young lady, a relative of one of the
officers, had taken the trouble to direct a letter to
each individual on board, containing a beautiful
Christmas card. To make it appear as if they had
been actually delivered through the post, a second-hand
postage-stamp had been affixed to each envelope.
Her kind forethought afforded a great deal of pleasure
to the recipients of those letters.</p>

<p>Christmas eve was spent very merrily by all on
board the &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo; The piano was carried out from
the ward-room to the main deck, where dancing was
kept up with great animation until eleven o&rsquo;clock!
It is wonderful how fond the English man-of-war&rsquo;s
man is of dancing. So long as he can obtain music
and a partner to dance with, without regard to sex,
he will continue to fling his legs about with great
vigour until compelled by heat and exhaustion to
desist! The men on board the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; were no
exception to this rule; one and all joined in the dance,
and seemed thoroughly to enjoy it. Poor Aldrich did
not get a moment&rsquo;s peace. As soon as one tune was
finished, he was called upon for another. Polka,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
waltz, and galop followed each other in rapid succession,
officers and men joining alike in the general
hilarity of the evening.</p>

<p>Christmas morning broke cold and clear; its stillness
occasionally interrupted by light puffs of wind
from the S.W. Divine service was performed in the
forenoon, the pulpit being decorated with branches
of artificial holly. When church was over, a little
exercise was taken on the &ldquo;ladies&rsquo; mile.&rdquo; On my
return I found my cabin brightened up by small
twigs of variegated holly, a delicate and touching
attention on the part of some of my messmates, who
had provided themselves with artificial branches of
this plant before leaving England. At one o&rsquo;clock,
everything being in readiness, the officers were invited
to inspect the lower deck. Preceded by our
drum and fife band playing the &ldquo;Roast Beef of Old
England,&rdquo; we paid a formal visit to the men&rsquo;s
quarters. The lower deck was beautifully and tastefully
decorated with flags, coloured tinsel paper, and
artificial flowers, whilst the different mess tables were
literally groaning under the weight of the good cheer
that adorned them. Everything had a cheerful and
comfortable appearance, and, above all, the radiant
healthy-looking faces, beaming with pleasure, that
so cordially and heartily greeted us with the compliments
of the season. Of course, dancing was the
prominent feature of the afternoon, Aldrich, with his
usual good nature, being again victimized at the
piano. At six o&rsquo;clock, for on such an important
occasion we departed from our usual dinner hour
of half-past two, we all assembled in the ward-room
for dinner, and great was our astonishment and
delight at seeing in the centre of our table a magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
bouquet of artificial flowers. This was, I
believe, the happy thought of a lady who had recently
been admitted into the circle of &ldquo;Arctic relations.&rdquo;
The bright-coloured flowers, reminding us of home
associations, were more thoroughly appreciated than
even the good dinner which was provided for us, for
which reference must be made to the following <i>menu</i>,
composed by Pullen:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center pt2 f90">H.M.S. &ldquo;ALERT.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our drum and fife band, of their own accord, played
several airs very creditably during our dinner, which
was brought to a conclusion by a few short speeches.
In the evening dancing was again kept up with great
animation; every one appeared cheerful and happy.
In no region of the world could this Christmas-day
have been spent with more mirth and more genuine
fellowship than it was by the little band of explorers,
so far removed from all home ties and associations,
who were celebrating it that day, in a latitude farther
north than man had ever before penetrated.</p>

<p>On reviewing the events of the year we felt we had
much to be thankful for. We had succeeded, in spite
of many dangers and difficulties, in establishing our
ship in winter quarters in a position farther north
than even some of the most sanguine had, at one time,
dared to hope. The English flag had been displayed,
both by sea and by land, in a higher northern latitude
than any flag had ever before been seen, and although
our prospects of further exploration in a northerly
direction were somewhat damped, owing to the land
trending west, we knew that there was much to be
done during the ensuing year in defining and exploring
the coasts to the east and to the west. A wide field
of exploration was still before us, and there was much
useful work to be done during the ensuing spring in a
hitherto unknown region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span></p>

<p>Half our winter had passed, and although the long
dark night of one hundred and fifty days might, by
some unacquainted with the many resources we
possessed to while away the time, be considered dull
and monotonous, monotony and despondency were
unknown on board the good ship &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo; We all
looked forward with eager hope to the return of the
sun, strong in our determination to do our best, and
with our appetites for sledging considerably whetted
by the initiation we had received during the autumn.</p>

<p>Hitherto we had, with one exception, enjoyed perfect
immunity from sickness, and we all thought that if
there was no cold weather in the Arctic Regions to
produce frost-bites, the appointments of medical
officers to the expedition, so far as their professional
qualifications were concerned, were undoubted sinecures.
The frost-bites had, however, been very severe,
and at the end of the year there still remained on the
sick list four of the poor fellows who had been attacked
during the autumn sledging, three of whom had
suffered amputation of the big toe.</p>

<p>Compelled to keep to their beds, the winter to them
must have, indeed, been wearisome; but no word of
complaint was ever uttered by them, and they appeared
as cheerful and in as good spirits as the best of us.
Their only distress was the idea of not being allowed,
in consequence of their misfortune, to participate in
the spring campaign. The sequel, however, proved,
although they took no part in the <i>extended</i> sledging
operations, how well and how nobly they worked in
their brave endeavours to assist and succour their
poor, weak, and stricken comrades; but we must not
anticipate.</p>

<p>We had hitherto experienced, in comparison with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>199</span>
what we had been led to expect, tolerably mild weather,
as Arctic winter weather goes; and the cold had not
been so severe as we anticipated; -46.5° or 78½° below
freezing-point being, up to the end of the year, the
minimum temperature registered. This was by no
means an uncomfortable temperature, although superficial
frost-bites, especially on the noses and cheekbones,
were of constant occurrence. Solitary walks
were, of course, prohibited; and it was particularly
impressed upon every one that, when they were
absent from the ship, they were carefully to watch
their companions&rsquo; faces in order to detect a frost-bite
at once, and so be able to restore circulation before
permanent injury could be sustained. Face-covers
were occasionally worn, but were not in very great
favour. They have the disadvantage of freezing to
the face, which they also conceal, and so prevent a
comrade from seeing and reporting a frost-bite.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of our winter quarters there
had, up to this time, been a remarkable absence of
all animal life. Occasionally the quarter-masters
would report that during the night they heard the
howling of wolves in the distance, and one night the
Eskimo dogs, who were lying curled up in the snow
outside the ship, made a sudden rush for the gangway,
and evinced great eagerness to get on board. This
stampede was attributed to the presence of wolves,
but no tracks of these animals had been seen to justify
our arriving at such a conclusion. With the exception
sometimes of a peculiar, whistling, moaning sound,
caused by the rise and fall of the ice with the tide, the
stillness of the nights was undisturbed.</p>

<p>We had long been aware that the ice of which this
part of the polar sea was composed consisted of huge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span>
massive floes, not of a few seasons&rsquo; formation, but
the creation of ages, real thick-ribbed ice. Except
along the west coasts of Banks and Prince Patrick
Islands, no such ice had ever before been met with in
the Arctic Regions. It therefore became desirable to
apply to it a special name by which it might be
provisionally known. After some discussion, Captain
Nares decided upon calling the frozen sea, on the
southern border of which we were wintering, the
&ldquo;Palæocrystic Sea,&rdquo; the name being derived from
the two Greek words <span class="grk" title="palaios">&#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> ancient, and <span class="grk" title="krystallos">&#954;&#961;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>
ice. This term was used for the great frozen polar
sea during the remaining period of our detention on
its borders.<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>Atmospheric phenomena, such as halos and
paraselenæ, were by no means uncommon, and occasionally
we were astonished by the heavenly bodies
behaving, as it appeared to us, in a very eccentric
manner. On one occasion the star Aldebaran was
reported to be jumping about in a strange way. Such
unusual behaviour on the part of a star brought us
all up in the cold, and there, sure enough, was Aldebaran
doing exactly what was reported, and altogether
conducting itself in a very erratic and unstarlike
manner. The illusion was caused by the fall of minute,
and imperceptible, frozen particles; but it was some
time before we could satisfy ourselves that the star was
not actually in motion, many of the men remaining to
this day unconvinced. One of our Scotch quarter-masters
informed me, some time afterwards, that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>
was a &ldquo;vara curious star;&rdquo; and although the laws of
refraction were explained to him, he still persisted in
his belief that the movement of the star was due to
itself, and would not believe in any other explanation.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the winter, shortly after the
return of the sledge parties, the doctor and myself
being busily engaged in the construction of a snow
house on shore, observed a most brilliant meteor fall,
apparently about a quarter of a mile from us, its
course being from S.E. to N.W. It was of a bright
emerald-green colour, and was falling so quietly and
slowly that we at first thought it was a rocket, or
Roman candle, let off by some one astern of the ship,
it being distinctly visible for many seconds. When it
arrived, in our estimation, at about forty feet from
the ground, it suddenly burst, displaying bright red
and green colours. It was seen by others, from
different points of observation; all being unanimous
in their opinion that it was one of the most beautiful
sights, of the kind, they had ever witnessed.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> above lines, composed by the poet laureate of
the expedition, greeted us at the breakfast table on
the morning of the 1st of January, 1876.</p>

<p>The New Year was ushered in with every demonstration
of joy, gratitude, and hope by our little party
assembled together, so far removed from the civilized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
world. We were joyful because a new year had
dawned upon us in undiminished numbers; grateful
for the many mercies that had been vouchsafed to
us, and hopeful concerning our future prospects.
We could not look back with regret upon the past
year, for to us it had indeed been eventful; but
officers and men looked forward to the coming year
with feelings of confidence, resolutely determined
faithfully to perform their duties, placing their trust
in Him who had hitherto so well watched over and
protected them, and firm in their reliance on His
continued aid and support.</p>

<p>It is generally the custom in the navy to strike the
bell sixteen times at midnight on New Year&rsquo;s eve&mdash;eight
bells for the old year and eight bells for the
new! Of course with us this custom was rigidly
adhered to; but not only did we strike sixteen bells
at <i>our</i> midnight, but we also struck the same number
at six minutes to eight, which, allowing for the exact
difference in time, would be midnight in England, so
that we had at least the satisfaction of knowing that
our bell was being employed in the same way as
many others in the navy at the same time.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be interesting to my readers to
know exactly how we received the New Year! I will,
therefore, quote my remarks as they appear, word for
word, in my journal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At five minutes to twelve, we all congregated
round the ward-room table, on which was spread a
sumptuous cold collation, consisting of a <i>real</i> English
ham, Bologna sausages, brawn, and sardines. Strong
whiskey punch, in the brewing of which all had a
share, was ladled out to each, and from the encomiums
which were passed on its flavour and strength,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
the old proverb that &lsquo;too many cooks spoil the broth&rsquo;
was completely upset. As the bell struck, a neat
little speech was made by our orator the doctor, the
compliments of the season were wished to all, nor
were those at home forgotten, our glasses were
emptied, and then in true Highland fashion, with one
foot on the table, the other on our chair, and with
hands joined, we all sang &lsquo;Auld lang syne,&rsquo; the drum
and fife band accompanying us outside, the song being
taken up by the men on the lower deck, who, true to
their tastes, had been &lsquo;<i>dancing</i> out the old year.&rsquo;
Such was the manner in which the year 1876 was
inaugurated in latitude 82° 27&prime; N., where no human
being had ever welcomed a new year before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A more cheerful, happy, and contented party it
would be difficult to imagine anywhere; utterly
oblivious of the solemn darkness and desolate sterility
that prevailed without, they thought only of the
&ldquo;joyous triumph&rdquo; that they hoped to achieve, and
then of their return to old England. Everything
wore a cheerful aspect. No leader could have more
reason to be satisfied with the health and spirits of
those under his command, than Captain Nares on the
1st of January, 1876.</p>

<p>On that morning, at the usual monthly medical
inspection, he had the satisfaction of receiving the
report that the men were in a better state of health
than they were at the last examination. Appetites,
which during mid-winter had been waning, had
gradually returned. So contented were we, that
many were actually pitying our friends in England,
because they were unable to enjoy such delicious
musk-ox beef as was put on our table for dinner on
New Year&rsquo;s day!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span></p>

<p>Our first crop of mustard and cress was gathered
on the 2nd of January. It was not an abundant one,
but there was sufficient to give a mouthful to each
person, and what little we had was certainly very
refreshing. It had grown up devoid of all colour, and
had a very <i>washed-out</i> appearance. The garden was
a small shallow box kept close to the ward-room stove.
In consequence of the success attending this&mdash;our first&mdash;attempt
at agriculture, several gardens were started,
and we were enabled to issue, at different times, small
quantities of this excellent antiscorbutic; though how
far the loss of colour detracts from its medicinal
qualities is a difficult problem to solve. Although the
colour was absent, the fresh <i>taste</i> appeared to remain,
there being no perceptible difference between that
grown on board the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; and the same reared in
the heat of the sun in more favoured climes. As a
rule, the best crops were those grown on a blanket.</p>

<p>On the 8th and 9th of January we experienced a
heavy gale of wind from the southward. It was impossible,
whilst it lasted, to venture outside the ship,
even to take the thermometric observations, although
they could be registered only a few yards from the
gangway: they had therefore to be discontinued
during the time the gale lasted. It blew for forty-eight
hours with relentless fury, when it exhausted
itself in fitful gusts, more or less strong, until it abated
altogether. The housing over the ship suffered sadly
from this storm, several tons weight of snow having
collected on it from the tremendous drift, in some
places breaking it through, and in others &ldquo;bagging&rdquo;
it down so as to render walking underneath an impossibility.</p>

<p>All our outdoor establishments were completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
buried with snow, and we were compelled to send
parties of men to excavate them, in order to effect an
entrance at all. In fact, our men were for some time
engaged in repairing the ravages of the storm. The
accumulation of drift on the weather side of the ship
was enormous, and took the form of a perfectly solid
snow-wreath. This was caused by the eddying wind
driving the snow from the side of the vessel to a distance
of about four or five feet, where it settled, resembling
a great frozen wave, whose curling crest was
fully seven feet in height.</p>

<p>On the opposite, or lee, side of the ship the ice had
cracked, leaving several large fissures, through which
the water oozed and flowed over. The spring tides
had also caused the ship to rise in her icy cradle, the
greater part of the banking having, in consequence,
slipped through between the edge of our dock and the
ship&rsquo;s side and disappeared. This also had to be
rectified. Our gale of wind had undoubtedly been
productive of much extra work, irrespective of the
anxiety and the by no means pleasant time spent,
during its duration: for as yet our protecting bergs
had not inspired us with absolute confidence regarding
the shelter they might afford in such tempestuous
weather as we had recently experienced. So well,
however, did they answer our purpose during this
gale, that all cause for anxiety was from that time
removed, and for the future we felt as safe and as
secure as if we had been frozen up in a well-sheltered
and land-locked harbour.</p>

<p>When the wind was at its height, a piece of musk-ox
meat, suspended in the mizzen-rigging, was blown
down, and was, of course, at once assailed by the
Eskimo dogs who had been admitted into the ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
during the gale. Fortunately it was frozen so hard
that they were unable to get their teeth through it,
and although it had been some time in their clutches
before it was rescued, little loss was sustained.</p>

<p>At noon on the 17th of January, a faint tinge of
crimson, blended with a slight silvery streak of
twilight, could be observed in the southern horizon,
and although it was only of short duration, it became
more decided and lasted for a longer time on each
successive day. These bright harbingers of returning
light were anxiously watched, and gladly were they
welcomed as they assumed a more decided appearance.</p>

<p>Although there was no despondency or depression
of spirits on board the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; the monotony of the
long dark nights could not but be felt, and we all
eagerly looked forward to the time when the glorious
rays from our bright, though long-absent, sun should
again crown the summits of the distant hills with their
sparkling and joyous light. All on board were interested
for different reasons in the return of the sun:
the sledge travellers, because it would bring light and
heat to cheer and sustain them on their lonesome and
arduous journeys, which they knew would be commenced
as soon after its return as possible: the sportsmen
regarded it as the precursor of game; and all
hailed with delight the symbol of returning day and
the assurance of the approaching termination of their
long dark night. By the 1st of February, those
gifted with sharp eyesight were just able to decipher
a leading article in the <i>Times</i> on the floe at noon. It
was remarked that one of our officers afflicted with
short-sightedness was able, by the dim twilight, to
read not only with greater ease and accuracy than
others, but also some days before them, and therefore
by a dimmer light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span></p>

<p>We had hitherto had no exceptionally severe
weather; but during the latter part of January we experienced
a foretaste of the intense cold that we were
a month later destined to endure. With a temperature
50° below zero, it is necessary, when exposed to it, to
keep the body in constant motion, otherwise a frost-bite
will imperceptibly seize hold of one. On first emerging
into this temperature a slight difficulty of breathing
would be experienced, and tears would be involuntarily
brought to the eyes, which immediately became small
nodules of ice, and as such had to be extracted. This
is hardly to be wondered at when it is remembered
that we had to undergo a transition of temperature
from our living-deck to the open air of over 100°! In
spite of this cold, however, we were not much troubled
with frost-bites, except on the face. Our dearly bought
experience, during the autumn sledging, will account
for our comparative immunity from these very troublesome
and painful attacks.</p>

<p>Apropos of frost-bites it is related, that one of the
members of the expedition, on getting up in the
morning, during the cold weather, found, to his
horror, that one of his toes and a part of his foot
were quite black. Thinking he was severely frost-bitten,
and wishing at once to assure himself of the
fact by the only practical method that suggested
itself at the time, he seized a pin, and made a furious
dig at the supposed injured part. He very quickly
found that, although discoloured, it was not totally
devoid of all sensation, nor was the circulation of
blood in any way impeded. The fact was, that his
servant, on the previous day, had patched up his
sock with a piece of fearnought, and, in order to
assimilate the colour, had inked it over&mdash;which fully
accounted for his terrible frost-bite!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span></p>

<p>It was our invariable custom to keep the hair, especially
that growing on the face, as close as possible.
In spite, however, of this precaution, it was impossible
to prevent the breath from freezing on the
short stubbly beard and moustache, which would soon
be converted into a perfect mass of ice&mdash;a decidedly
uncomfortable appendage. On returning from our
short walks, we frequently found our cap, comforter,
and collar of the coat frozen into one solid and compact
mass.</p>

<p>Occasionally an amusing incident occurred to vary
the sameness of our daily life, as the following story
will show. During the darkest part of the winter one
of the magnetic observers had occasion to visit the
observatory. Taking his lantern, and accompanied
by Nellie, he reached the door, which to his surprise
was open. Supposing it to have been blown open by
the wind, for it had been blowing very hard the
previous night, he entered the long tunnel leading
up to the Unifilar House. Before he had gone far
a strong animal smell assailed his olfactory organs;
this, with the fact of Nellie exhibiting great restlessness,
induced him to examine the ground, when he
clearly detected the traces of some animal, but of
what description he was unable to decide.</p>

<p>He was now placed in rather an unpleasant position,
for to advance head-foremost through a narrow
passage into a small house in which a great Polar
bear might have established himself, was to say the
least a rash act; yet he was unwilling to return on
board, and probably be for ever after chaffed by his
messmates for being frightened at nothing. Putting
on a bold front, he determined at all hazards to push
on, and ascertain what the animal was that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
dared to violate the sacred precincts of the observatory.
As he advanced the peculiar odour became
stronger, and he was sorely tempted to retreat,
thinking discretion was the better part of valour.
Arriving at the entrance to the house, however, he
plucked up courage, and with the lantern well in
front of him, and Nellie close at his heels, he dashed
in, and there, lying down and looking almost as
frightened as himself, was, not the great white bear
that he expected to meet, but &ldquo;Bruin,&rdquo; the largest
of our Eskimo dogs, who, during the boisterous
weather of the preceding night, had sought shelter
in our observatory, and had no doubt found it a very
snug and comfortable place, infinitely preferable to
the bleak and exposed floe. It was a long time before
the place was rid of the unpleasant smell peculiar to
Eskimo dogs.</p>

<p>As the light increased day by day, the men were
employed in re-embarking the stores and provisions
landed, and in demolishing &ldquo;Markham Hall.&rdquo; It
was necessary to accomplish as much as possible, as
Captain Nares well knew, before the departure of the
sledging parties, for so few men would be left on
board that little could be done during their absence,
and there was no saying how soon after their return
the ship would be able to break out of winter
quarters. The Eskimo dogs were also now regularly
fed and attended to. Hitherto they had been left to
do pretty much as they liked, and their regular meals
during the winter had been few, and served at uncertain
times. Notwithstanding the small amount of
food that was issued to them, they were all in capital
condition, in fact a little too &ldquo;fleshy&rdquo; for dragging
purposes, as they always received the scraps and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>
surplus food from the allowance of the ship&rsquo;s company,
and this was more than enough to keep a much
larger pack of dogs than we possessed. They were
also regularly exercised in dragging a light sledge,
their day&rsquo;s work increasing as the days lengthened.</p>

<p>We could not but notice the sallowness of complexion
which the returning light revealed, only too
palpably, in the faces of our companions, caused by
the long absence of the sun, and which had hitherto
been unnoticed by the light of lamps and candles.
Like our mustard and cress, we were devoid of all
colour, yet apparently in good and sound health.
There is something essentially health-preserving and
life-giving in the rays of the sun, without which
everything must wither and eventually die. This
was, in the sequel, but too fully exemplified in our
case. For although we were all in excellent spirits
and supposed ourselves to be in perfect health, yet
the seeds of that terrible disease, which subsequently
crippled us so disastrously, must have already germinated
unknown to ourselves.</p>

<p>But little did we suspect, at that time, the approach
of the evil that eventually overtook us.</p>

<p>Many of the large floe-bergs near the ship were observed
to be literally rent in twain, owing in all probability
to the contraction of the ice by the intense
cold&mdash;the outer part of the floeberg being exposed to
a greater cold than the interior. These rents will
also account for the loud sharp reports that were
frequently heard during the winter, and which were
for some time wrapped in mystery.</p>

<p>Towards the end of February a few hares were
seen, and two or three were shot; but they were very
timid and shy, and seldom gave our sportsmen opportunities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
of exhibiting their prowess. Lemming tracks
were abundant, and occasionally these little animals
would be seen running along the snow. Nellie regarded
them as being created for her especial enjoyment
in hunting, and would vainly endeavour to unsnow
them after they had taken refuge in their holes.
Woe betide the unfortunate little lemming observed
by Nellie at any distance from its habitation. A
dash, a gobble, and all was over! In vain did we
try to break her of these murderous propensities, not
only for the sake of the victims but also for herself, as
the swallowing of little balls of fur cannot be conducive
to health. All was futile! Nellie considered
the chase of these little creatures as an undoubted
privilege with which no one should interfere.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">LEMMINGS.</td></tr></table>

<p>The long twilight enabled us to extend our rambles,
and we visited the snow hut built by Rawson last
autumn when attempting to get south, about five or
six miles from the ship, and in which he had deposited
a small quantity of provisions. To our surprise we
discovered that, with the exception of the pemmican
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
which was in a tin, and the tobacco, all had disappeared!
Biscuit, bacon, tea, sugar, and cocoa, all
had gone. A hole through the roof of the house
pointed at once to the means of ingress; but who
were the thieves? Foxes or wolves had not been
seen, nor had any traces of them been observed!</p>

<p>Even supposing these animals to be the depredators,
how did they effect their escape from the house after
once they had got in? It was simple enough to scrape
a hole through the roof and jump down; but it was
not so easy to jump straight up a height of six or
seven feet through a small hole! Suspicion fell for
some time on our long-missing dog Sallie; but it was
never satisfactorily ascertained whether dog, wolf, or
fox was the culprit. Of one thing there could be no
doubt. The robbery had been committed by a very
cunning and intelligent beast. Spots of blood on the
pemmican tin showed unmistakeably that this also
had been attempted, but had proved too hard and
strong. The tracks, which were always to and from
the floe, were too indistinct to enable us to make out
the nature of the animal, but the general idea was
that it was a fox.</p>

<p>Of course, with returning daylight, the serious work
of sledging and the preparations for the spring campaign
occupied our attention to the exclusion of almost
everything else. On Saturday, the 26th of February,
our school assembled for the last time, the classes
being dismissed in the evening only to reassemble
again if the ship spent another winter away from
England. It would not be fair to dismiss our pupils
without a word of commendation. Their attendance
was most regular, and their efforts to learn beyond
all praise. Nothing could exceed their diligence, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span>
excel their desire to please and reflect credit upon
their masters, and I do hope that many will have
benefited by the instruction they received in their
Arctic school.</p>

<p>This piece, as set forth in the bill, was written expressly
for the occasion by Pullen, and not only did
he compose it, but he also assisted in its performance.
It was a very successful hit, and was most deservedly
applauded, loud cries of &ldquo;Author&rdquo; following the fall
of the curtain.</p>

<p>The ensuing Thursday witnessed the last of our
&ldquo;Thursday Pops,&rdquo; and this terminated our season&rsquo;s
festivities. At it Captain Nares delivered a very able
and instructive lecture on his sledging experiences,
bringing a few &ldquo;facts&rdquo; home to the men, as to the
sort of work they were about to perform, and the kind
of life they would have to lead. His announcement
that we should, in all probability, spend another
winter in the Arctic Regions was hailed with delight.
He also announced his intention of returning to
England before the third winter, provided no unforeseen
event happened to detain the expedition.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> 29th of February was the day on which,
according to astronomical rules, the reappearance of
the sun was to rejoice the hearts and gladden the
eyes of our little party. On the previous day, a
general holiday had been proclaimed to give the men
a chance, by ascending some of the hills in our
neighbourhood, of welcoming the sun a day earlier.
In this, however, they were doomed to disappointment.
The glorious orb would not come out to be
welcomed; for the simple reason that it was still
just below the horizon. We were, however, rewarded
by seeing its rays reflected in the northern sky, which
was beautifully illumined with the most brilliant
prismatic colours. Cairn Hill, and the hills to the
southward by Cape Rawson, were the chief points of
observation. The former was abreast of the ship,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
and about a mile distant; its height being about
four hundred and fifty feet above the level of the sea.
On the summit was built a large cairn, hence its
name. On the cairn was reared a long staff, to which
was hoisted an iron oil cask, so as to form a
conspicuous landmark to guide wanderers back to
their ship.</p>

<p>By ten o&rsquo;clock on the forenoon of the 29th, the
ship was nearly deserted, and officers and men could
be seen dotting the floe and snow-covered ranges as
they wended their way to the most prominent adjacent
hills, on which little knots of men could already be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
seen assembled, in order to catch a glimpse of the
rising sun. We feared, however, on starting, that we
should be again disappointed, as there was no clear
sea horizon to the southward, and the sun would
hardly have sufficient altitude to show itself above
the distant land. These fears were not without foundation,
as the result proved.</p>

<p>Shortly before noon our excitement was intense as
a bright ray shot up vertically from the sun&rsquo;s position
and illumined the summits of the surrounding ranges,
whilst a radiant light was shed around.</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;As rays around the source of light</p>
<p class="i05">Stream upward ere he glow in sight,</p>
<p class="i05">And watching by his future flight</p>
<p class="i05">Set the clear heavens on fire.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>Our hopes grew high as noon drew near, but again
were we disappointed, and again were we compelled
to return to the ship, defeated in our object of
welcoming back the &ldquo;Prodigal Sun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day was cloudy, but on the following one,
by going aloft about ten o&rsquo;clock, we had the satisfaction
of announcing that about one-third of the sun&rsquo;s
disc was visible, as it crept slowly along the southern
horizon. Instantly the rigging swarmed with men,
scrambling up with elephantine agility to greet the
fiery orb after its long absence, and looking more
like animated bales of furs than human beings. It
appeared of a deep reddish orange colour, but was so
distorted by refraction that its shape was more that of
a truncated cone than a spherical body.</p>

<p>By noon Cairn Hill was covered with expectant
visitors, and well were they repaid for the trouble of
the ascent. Although little of the sun could be seen
above the distant land, we knew that it was there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
and what we did see was bright, and <i>appeared</i> with a
slight stretch of the imagination to be warm!</p>

<p class="noind">were on our lips as we beheld the beautiful colours in
the northern sky. The roseate tints blending with the
violet seemed to belong more to southern climes than
to the sterile inclement regions that we were inhabiting.
The summits of the hills, the &ldquo;misty mountain tops,&rdquo;
were bathed in its glorious rays, whilst its luminous
beams danced and glimmered along the distant ice-floes.
It was a bright and glorious sight, and we remained
long admiring it, and revelling in its rays&mdash;in
fact, until warned by a peculiar sensation in our feet
that the temperature was actually 100° below freezing-point;
and however ecstatic we might feel at the reappearance
of the sun, Jack Frost still reigned
supreme, exacting implicit obedience to his will, and
making those who disregarded his injunctions suffer
for their heedlessness.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Arctic Regions, and the farther
north the better, would be a good place for Parsees;
for none of the followers of Zoroaster could have exhibited
more anxiety for the return, and more delight
at the appearance, of their deity, than we did before
and after the bright rays of the sun first fell upon us!
Their god Fire would also receive, during the long cold
Polar winter, the utmost homage and attention. Sun
and Fire worshippers would require in these regions
little to stimulate them to devotion.</p>

<p>Strange to say, our extreme cold came with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
returning sun. During the latter end of February
the temperature had been gradually getting lower and
lower, until on the 4th of March it had fallen to -74°,
or 106° below freezing-point. This was the lowest
recorded by the expedition, obtained from the mean
of several thermometers, and, so far as we could
ascertain, the lowest really authentic corrected observation
that has ever been registered in any part
of the globe. From noon of the 3rd until noon of
the 4th the mean temperature was -69°.68, whilst
the lowest mean temperature registered for any twenty-four
consecutive hours was from four <span class="scs">A.M.</span> of the former
until four <span class="scs">A.M.</span> of the last-mentioned day -70°.31.
From six <span class="scs">P.M.</span> on March 2nd until six <span class="scs">A.M.</span> of March
4th, namely thirty-six consecutive hours, the mean
temperature was as low as -69°.93&prime;, and for the week
ending March 4th the mean temperature was -60°!</p>

<p>It was amusing to observe the eager excitement with
which every one received the latest intelligence regarding
the state of the thermometer, and when it was
announced that the &ldquo;lowest on record&rdquo; had been
registered, there was a general shout of exultation.
During the intense cold several experiments were tried
by exposing various substances to its influence, and
with the following results. Glycerine, on which a
temperature of -50° had little effect, became, at -70°,
perfectly solid and quite transparent. Rectified
spirits of wine became of the consistency of hair-oil.
Concentrated rum, 40° over-proof, froze hard
when exposed in a shallow vessel like a saucer, but
when in a large quantity it resembled honey or
molasses in consistency. Whiskey froze hard, and
we actually broke off bits and ate it! In consequence
of this latter proceeding we have since our return to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
England been, not without reason, accused of &ldquo;hard
drinking,&rdquo; an accusation we are, of course, unable to
refute! Chloroform was the only substance on which
the low temperature had no apparent effect. Our
temperatures were obtained by taking the mean of
ten thermometers that were exposed, to which result
was applied the corrections from Kew for each instrument.
These had been ascertained when the
instruments were tested at the Kew observatory before
leaving England. The corrections and errors of the
instruments could, of course, only be approximately
ascertained after the freezing-point of mercury had
been passed, as there was nothing beyond that with
which the spirit could be compared. The slightest
impurity of the spirit used, or the presence of even
the most minute portions of extraneous matter in it,
would no doubt seriously affect the accuracy of the
observation. As an instance of the range exhibited
by these instruments, it may be interesting to know
that one thermometer indicated as low a temperature
as -82°, while, <i>at the same time</i>, another showed only
-60°; but by applying the errors deduced at Kew, the
result was as nearly as possible the same. I think
that the minimum temperature recorded by us was, if
not absolutely correct, as nearly so as it was possible
to arrive at.</p>

<p>Although we never again experienced such a severe
burst of cold as we did during the first few days of
March, the temperature remained extraordinarily low,
and mercury was in a frozen state during nearly the
whole of that month. The presence of the sun appeared
to have little effect on the temperature, but
thermometers exposed to its rays would frequently rise
as high as zero, and sometimes above that point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span></p>

<p>The difference of temperature at the summit and
at the base of Cairn Hill, whose height, as has been
stated, was four hundred and fifty feet, was 5½°, the
thermometer rising as the hill was ascended, and
falling again as it was brought down.</p>

<p>Traces of ptarmigan had frequently been observed
in the snow, but it was not until the 22nd of March
that the first bird was seen, although our sportsmen
had been most diligent in their search for them. On
that day two of our pedestrians succeeding in flushing
one solitary ptarmigan, but, as is usual in such cases,
they were without guns. Very few of these birds were
afterwards seen in the neighbourhood of the &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;
Their appearance caused some little excitement, for
we looked upon them as the harbingers of spring,
and as a token that our long winter had well-nigh
terminated.</p>

<p>On the 25th of March, there was a partial eclipse
of the sun, which was clearly visible to all those who
took the trouble to go on deck and, with a piece of
smoked or coloured glass, examine it in spite of a very
low temperature. The first contact was observed at
six minutes past four in the afternoon, and the egress
at six o&rsquo;clock. About .65, or little more than half the
sun, was obscured.</p>

<p>During the middle of March the quarter-deck
housing was removed, and we were again able to
enjoy daylight on the upper deck. Although the low
temperature did not yet admit of our removing the
snow from the hatchways and skylights, yet we were
able to clear the tops of our cabin illuminators, and
thus obtain below a slight amount of daylight, sufficient
at any rate to obviate the necessity of incessant
candle-light during the day. It was not until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
middle of May, whilst the sledge travellers were
absent, that the skylights were cleared and the snow
removed from the upper deck.</p>

<p>Fire is the most disastrous accident that can possibly
happen to a ship wintering in the Arctic Regions,
and it should be most carefully guarded against. It
may result in having your house, together with all
your provisions, consumed, and yourselves, perhaps
not burnt, but destined for even a more terrible fate,
namely, turned out on the ice without food and without
shelter, exposed to a pitiless temperature, with no
covering or protection of any description. Such a
situation would prove fatal in a few hours. Men so
placed would realize the dreadful fate so vividly and
graphically described by Jules Verne as having befallen
Captain Hatteras and his companions when their ship
was destroyed and they were deserted by their shipmates.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; we had one alarm from fire, which,
although it might have ended disastrously, did very
little injury. It originated in our &ldquo;drying-room,&rdquo;
where, through the carelessness of the man in charge,
some of the clothes had been allowed to hang in
dangerous proximity to the stove. These igniting
quickly communicated the fire to the surrounding
objects, and for a little time it was doubtful whether
the conflagration might not assume a very serious
aspect. In spite of the occurrence happening at night-time,
the men exerted themselves with such good will
that the fire was speedily extinguished, with no further
damage done than the destruction of a few clothes,
although it was some time before we could rid ourselves
of the smoke, which unpleasantly permeated
the whole ship. The temperature at the time was 58°
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
below zero, which would have rendered the work of
supplying water from the fire-hole not only a difficult,
but also a dangerous task, and one which must have
resulted in many severe frost-bites.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the month of March the
officers were employed in dismounting the various
instruments in the observatories, carefully packing
and putting them away, as most of them would not
be required again until the following winter. This
was a very necessary proceeding, as before the return
of the officers from sledge travelling the observatories
with all their &ldquo;fixings,&rdquo; such as pedestals, etc., being
composed of snow, would have melted away during
the summer thaw. By the end of the month the
observatories were entirely stripped and left bare,
when they gradually fell into decay. &ldquo;Woolwich&rdquo;
was also &ldquo;unsnowed,&rdquo; and the powder brought off to
the ship and stowed in the magazine.</p>

<p>In addition to all this work, the crews of the
different sledges destined to take part in the spring
campaign were, in this month of March, specially
exercised, under their respective officers, for several
hours during the day. Their regular daily exercise
had also been carefully attended to throughout the
winter.</p>

<p>Occasionally they were employed laying out
depôts of provisions to the southward, to be used by
the sledge parties proceeding northwards from the
&ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; or sometimes dragging their laden
sledges over the pack in the immediate vicinity of
the ship, with the object of gaining experience in
crossing ridges of hummocks, and of realizing the
kind of travelling with which they were so soon to
become more intimately acquainted. These little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
journeys gave us an insight into the endless difficulties
that we were hereafter called upon to contend
with, and the obstacles we were destined to surmount.
We foresaw that we should have &ldquo;stiffish&rdquo;
work before us, but we did not doubt that we should
render a good and satisfactory account of the duty
entrusted to us.</p>

<p>After several cries of &ldquo;wolf,&rdquo; one actually did
make its appearance on the 1st of April. Early in
the morning of that day an animal had been observed,
by the quarter-master of the watch, stealthily prowling
round the ship. Supposing it to be a bear, the
alarm was given and one or two of our hunters
went in chase. More would undoubtedly have followed
their example, but recollecting the day, they
preferred remaining in their warm beds for an hour
longer to the risk of being informed, when they came
on deck fully equipped for the chase, that it was the
1st of April!</p>

<p>The traces left in the snow showed unmistakeably
the character of our visitor. Instead of being a
bear, it proved to be a wolf, but so alarmed was it
at the disturbance made on board that it scampered
over the hills and eluded our pursuit. That same
afternoon, however, accompanied by my usual companion
Nellie, I took a long walk to the southward,
following the trail of the wolf for some distance.
On my return, and when about two miles and a half
from the ship, I happened to look round, and there,
about a hundred yards off, and following in my track,
was a tall, gaunt, raw-boned and famished-looking
wolf. He was of a yellowish colour, and in size
larger than our biggest Eskimo dog. Of course, as
is generally the way in cases of this sort, I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
totally unprovided with arms of any description, and
was therefore unable to add his skin to our natural
history collection. I cannot say whether Nellie or
her master offered the greatest attraction to this
animal; but whichever it might be, he followed us,
sometimes at not more than ten yards distance,
stopping if we stopped, and advancing when we
advanced, until we were within about half a mile
from the ship, when some of my messmates coming
out to meet me, he bolted over the hills and made
his escape. My great anxiety at the time was for
my poor old Nellie, who showed a great inclination
to become better acquainted with the wolf, and I had
the utmost difficulty in restraining her. Whenever
she strayed a little from my heel, the brute would
make a bolt at her, and I have little doubt that she
would have been killed if he had once succeeded in
his endeavours. On the same evening we discovered
the tracks of four musk-oxen, but although we
followed them up for many miles we did not succeed
in seeing them. The fact of the latter being in our
neighbourhood fully accounted for the presence of
the wolf, who was no doubt following their tracks.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Hitherto</span> I have purposely abstained from alluding
to our spring operations, as I thought that it would
be better to devote a separate chapter exclusively to
the account of the details of sledge equipment. But
it must not be supposed, because I have omitted to
say anything about the sledging during the winter,
that it was neglected, and that our time was entirely
occupied with our amusements and observatory duties.
Such was not the case. The preparations for the
spring campaign and the organization of our sledge
parties in all its details were very carefully thought
over and matured during the long dark hours of the
winter. All works on this subject had been diligently
read, in order that we might benefit by the experience
of our predecessors. Nothing was neglected that
could in any way conduce to the success of the enterprise,
and everything that could possibly add to the
health and comfort of those to be employed on work
of such an arduous nature was carefully considered.
The sledges, tents, and other equipments necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
for travelling had been constructed under the personal
superintendence of Sir Leopold McClintock, who is
the highest living authority on Arctic sledge travelling.
A few alterations, which we trusted would also be
improvements, were suggested by the experience
gained during the autumn, and these were all carried
out before the return of the sun. The results justified
our anticipations. Out of the four different kinds
of sledges supplied to the expedition those which
found most favour with us, and with which the
greatest part of the work was done, were the eight-men
sledges.<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> These dragged easier, and were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
stronger than either the smaller or larger description
of sledges. So long as the travelling remains good,
that is smooth and level ice with hard snow on its
surface, these sledges may be loaded to 240 lbs. for
each man to drag, and a good day&rsquo;s work to be
accomplished. This weight, of course, would only
be dragged on first leaving the ship, or a depôt, and
decreases at the rate of about 3 lbs. per man per
diem, the amount of provisions consumed by each
individual. What are called the &ldquo;constant&rdquo; weights,
which include the sledge, tent, robes, cooking apparatus,
pickaxe, shovel, etc., remain unaltered during
the journey. The question of weight is one requiring
the closest attention.</p>

<p>Every trifling article, even to a small packet of a
<i>dozen pins</i> placed in the medicine chest, has to be
weighed and recorded in the general equipment. The
following table shows the weight of the various articles
(being constant weights) required for the equipment
of an Arctic sledge for forty-five days:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">which, dragged by seven men, is equivalent to about
238 lbs. per man to drag.</p>

<p>This should never be exceeded, nor should it even
be kept up for any length of time.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that it is impossible for a
sledge party to be absent from the ship for more than
seven weeks, at the outside, on its own resources.
In order, therefore, to enable it to remain away for
a longer period, depôts of provisions are established
during the autumn on the line of route, and auxiliary
sledges are despatched in the spring from which the
extended parties may be replenished with provisions
after they have been away from the ship some two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
or three weeks. These auxiliary sledges, on their
return, are again completed with provisions and sent
out to meet the extended parties on their way back.
By these means, a sledging party may remain away
for as long as twelve or thirteen weeks.</p>

<p>Depôts can only be laid out when there is a continuous
coast line, and under circumstances when a
<i>cache</i> containing provisions can easily be discovered.
When the frozen ocean has to be traversed, depôts
cannot be depended upon; for a movement of the ice,
or the misfortune of wandering off the outward bound
track during thick weather, would deprive the travellers
of any chance of finding their supplies. The
result in such a case would probably be fatal. The
only way of ensuring an extended absence to a party
sledging over the pack, is by sending with it an
additional sledge. This, of course, entails the necessity
of traversing the same road three times over.
For the men must never under any circumstances
(other than unavoidable necessity, caused by the
sickness of some of the crew) be allowed to drag
more than the outside weight of 240 lbs. at any one
time.</p>

<p>It would, I think, and I am now speaking from
experience, be preferable, when such a journey is
necessary, to send a sledge away for only six weeks
rather than to provision a party for three months,
and compel the men to undergo the monotonous and
wearisome work of going over the same ground so
often; and, I believe, quite as much work would be
accomplished.</p>

<p>The tents were all made of the lightest duck,<a name="fa2n" id="fa2n" href="#ft2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
which was sufficient to protect us from the falling
or drifting snow, and the keen cutting wind. The
space inside was, of necessity, very limited; the
width in which each man had to sleep being only
fourteen inches. Whilst his head was touching one
side of the tent, his feet were in contact with the
other. The slightest movement of the sleeper during
the night would disturb his neighbours on either
side.</p>

<p>The entrance to the tent had a porch attached to
it, which was, of course, always carefully closed, and
served to exclude the fine snow-drift that would otherwise
have penetrated into the interior. The opposite
side of the tent was fitted in a similar manner for the
protection of the cook whilst engaged in preparing
the meals. The duties of the cook during intensely
cold weather entail hardships which it is scarcely possible
to overrate. The poor cook is never in his sleeping
bag until two or three hours after the rest of the
party have been comfortably settled for the night, and
he has always to rise in the morning a couple of
hours before his comrades are disturbed, and this
after a hard and fatiguing day&rsquo;s work. His cooking
apparatus consists of a spirit lamp, a stearine lamp,
a kettle, and a stew-pan. His fuel is either spirits of
wine, or cocoa-nut stearine; and as the allowance
of either is strictly limited, he has to be as economical
as he possibly can. Should his fuel be consumed
before the meal is cooked, he will get no more, and
the pemmican will have to be eaten in a semi-frozen
state. The odour and smoke emitted by the stearine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
can only be appreciated by those who have served
their apprenticeship as cooks to an Arctic sledge
party! Many experiments were tried during the
winter to improve our cooking apparatus, but few
were attended with success. Mr. White devoted a
good deal of thought and time to this important
matter. By introducing a cone into the kettle and
stew-pan he succeeded in gaining a decided advantage
in rapidity of cooking, but then his plan also had its
disadvantages, a difficulty of cleaning and an encroachment
on valuable space being the chief objections
to it. By giving the bottom of the pans and
kettles a little more concavity, we gained a slight
advantage in point of time, and time in cooking also
means an economy of fuel. The tent robes, coverlets,
and sleeping bags were all made of duffel. The knapsacks
were made of duck, and contained the only
spare clothing that each man was allowed to take.
The contents consisted of two pairs of blanket wrappers,
one pair of wadmill hose, one pair of moccasins,
a skull-cap for sleeping in, a woollen cap presented
to each person in the expedition by H.I.M. the Empress
Eugénie, two pairs of mitts, a flannel shirt, a
pair of drawers, a comforter, a pair of snow-spectacles,
a towel, and a piece of soap. The latter was
rather a superfluous article until the thaw set in.</p>

<p>The store bag contained the pemmican chopper and
board, a snow-knife and saw, some spare lashings of
hide for the sledge, matches, slow match, twine, and
various other small and useful articles.</p>

<p>The scale of provisions to be used whilst sledging
was almost identical with that of preceding expeditions,
the only difference being that we reduced the
allowance of spirits by half and doubled the amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
of tea and sugar. The following was the daily ration
for each man:&mdash;</p>

<p>This we found a very ample allowance, and one
that could not, in my opinion, be improved upon.
The different articles were excellent of their kind, and
of very superior quality.</p>

<p>Since our return to England, fault has been found
with our leader because lime-juice was not included
in the scale of dietary for the sledges, during April,
as a daily ration. Our scale of diet was necessarily
based on that of preceding expeditions, and we had
no reason to expect that we should suffer from that
dread disease, scurvy, any more than did our predecessors.
Lime-juice had never before been taken as
a daily ration by an extended sledge party, and Sir
Leopold McClintock, the highest living authority, has
since publicly declared that, in following the precedents
established by former experience as regards the
lime-juice, Sir George Nares acted exactly as he would
have done under the same circumstances. Moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
the lime-juice was supplied in a form that made it
impossible to use during an Arctic March, April, or
May, away from the ship. It was in bottles or very
large heavy jars, and, of course, the moment such
vessels were placed near a fire to thaw their contents,
in such a temperature, they would have been cracked
to pieces. This is a conclusive answer to those who,
without experience, and ignorant of the conditions
under which we travelled, have expressed opinions on
this subject. After May, when it was possible to use
it, lime-juice was always taken by our sledge parties
as a daily ration. When we came home, the use was
suggested of lime-juice lozenges, and the Medical
Director General has proposed that lime-juice should
be mixed with pemmican. It is certainly very much
to be regretted that some such arrangements were
not made and carried out before the expedition left
England. It will be seen (if lime-juice would really
have prevented the attack of scurvy) how terribly
we had to suffer from the consequences of the omission.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parr and myself each took two bottles
of lime-juice, with the intention of using it when the
warm weather of June arrived. It was not possible
to use it to any advantage, hard frozen in a bottle,
during March, April, or May.</p>

<p>Dr. Colan drew up very careful medical instructions
for the commanders of sledges, and each received
some elementary surgical instruction. The doctor
also paid most anxious attention to the contents of
the medical chest, the weight of which was not allowed
to exceed 12 lbs.<a name="fa3n" id="fa3n" href="#ft3n"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span></p>

<p>The clothing worn by the men engaged in the
sledging operations was somewhat different from that
in use during the winter. Our under clothing was
made of thick flannel. Over this we wore one or two
flannel or check shirts, long sleeved woollen waist-coats,
thick knitted guernseys, and duffel trousers,
the latter reaching about a foot below the knee. All
wore broad flannel belts, commonly called cholera
belts, round their loins. On our heads we had
woollen helmet caps, called by the men &ldquo;Eugenies,&rdquo;
and over this was worn a thick sealskin cap with ear
and neck flaps attached.</p>

<p>Our feet were encased in blanket wrappers, one or
two pairs according to the temperature, a pair of thick
woollen hose reaching above the knees and worn over
the trousers, and moccasins. The latter, as supplied
to us, only came up round the ankle, so we fitted
them with leggings. Those who were provided with
chamois leather made their leggings of that material,
but the majority cut the sleeves off their check shirts
which, when sewn on to the moccasin, answered
admirably, their chief use being to keep the snow
from penetrating into the trousers. Some of the
moccasins were also soled with leather, obtained by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
cutting off the upper part of the fishermen&rsquo;s boots, a
pair of which had been supplied to each person. As
a rule these soles were quickly worn out, and the men
were soon reduced to the bare moccasin, which, however,
lasted wonderfully.</p>

<p>Large gauntlet mitts were made during the winter,
of fearnought covered with duck, and worn with a
strap round the neck. These were only supplied to
the sledgers, and were found very useful. At night-time
they were used on the feet in the sleeping bags,
and certainly assisted very materially in keeping them
warm. Finally each person was provided with a suit
of duck overalls, to act as &ldquo;snow repellers,&rdquo; which
were always worn whilst on the march. As an extra
precaution against snow-blindness, the men were
ordered to paint some device on the backs of these
snow jumpers in order to afford a certain amount of
relief to the eyes of their comrades. The designs of
these devices or crests were left entirely to the artistic
imaginations of the men, and they caused a good
deal of merriment. They were certainly more quaint
than elegant. Donkeys and Polar bears in various
wonderful positions appeared to be in the greatest
favour. Each crest was accompanied by a motto,
invariably a Latin one. Whether these devices relieved
us from severe attacks of snow-blindness or
not it would be difficult to decide. They served at
any rate to amuse us, and often formed the topic of
conversation when other subjects were getting scarce.
Snow-spectacles were invariably used by the travellers,
and were only taken off after the party had
halted for the night and had sought the shelter of
their tent. In consequence of the adoption of these
snow-goggles when we first set out on our travels, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
were comparatively exempt from that painful disease,
snow-blindness, from which other expeditions have
more or less suffered, and which renders the patient
so attacked utterly helpless. We occasionally had a
few cases, but with one or two exceptions they were in
a very mild form.</p>

<p>Such were the details of the general equipment
of the sledging parties that were despatched from the
&ldquo;Alert&rdquo; in the spring of 1876. Officers and men
shared alike in everything; they had the same provisions,
their costume was identical, they shared the
same couch and tent, and each showed the same
zealous desire to perform his duty, and the same
eager anxiety to bring to a successful issue the service
on which they were employed.</p>

<p>Although the whole of the available force on board
the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; was engaged in the sledging operations
of the spring, we were only able to despatch <i>two</i>
extended parties.<a name="fa4n" id="fa4n" href="#ft4n"><span class="sp">4</span></a> The rest of the men and sledges
were required to act as auxiliaries to the advanced
parties, and were continually employed during the
summer until the return of all the travellers brought
our sledging operations to a conclusion.</p>

<p>The programme to be carried out, and which was
determined upon after very mature and careful deliberation,
was for one party, the command of which
was given to Aldrich the first lieutenant, to continue
the discoveries of the autumn by exploring the coast
line to the westward; whilst a larger party, which
was entrusted to my conduct, was to push across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
rugged polar pack, and endeavour to reach as high
a northern latitude as possible. The exploration of
the north side of Greenland, to the eastward, and the
examination of the fiords in Robeson Channel, were
left to the sledge parties from the &ldquo;Discovery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The difficulties to be encountered and the serious
obstacles to be overcome in the journey due north
over the frozen sea were well understood. We had
made ourselves acquainted with the nature of the
travelling to be anticipated by various short excursions
on the ice in the vicinity of the ship, and were,
therefore, fully aware of the serious character of the
work that was before us. None were so rash as to
indulge in any extravagant ideas of successfully reaching
a very high position. The parallel of 84°, or
perhaps 85° by the more sanguine, was regarded as
the highest that could possibly be attained.</p>

<p>It was a well-known fact, before the ship went into
winter quarters, that the polar pack, composed of
extraordinarily heavy ice, was in motion at that
season. This motion, or perhaps a general disruption,
would occur, it was calculated, in about July
or August, possibly in June. It was, therefore, not
only a measure of prudence, but one of absolute
necessity, that the party destined to travel over this
frozen ocean should be provided with the means of
safety to themselves, if a disruption should take place
at an earlier period than was anticipated. It was
therefore decided that two boats,<a name="fa5n" id="fa5n" href="#ft5n"><span class="sp">5</span></a> capable of conveying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
the whole party from one floe to another, should
form part of the equipment of the northern division.
This additional weight, of course, seriously augmented
the labour of the men.</p>

<p>The only previous attempt to advance over a frozen
sea, away from the land, was made by Sir Edward
Parry, in his memorable journey towards the North
Pole in 1827.<a name="fa6n" id="fa6n" href="#ft6n"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span></p>

<p>For reasons already stated, the northern party was
unable to lay out depôts on the ice, nor could our
sledges be met by supporting sledges until after their
return to the land. It therefore became necessary
that they should carry with them sufficient provisions
to last for the whole time of anticipated absence.
This, with the boats, obliged the two sledge crews
composing the division to take with them a <i>third</i>
sledge, so that under the most favourable conditions
of travelling, they would be compelled, after advancing
two sledges, to return over the same road and drag
on the third. This we fondly hoped on starting we
should be able to accomplish; little did we think that
the fearfully rugged nature of the road would necessitate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
the same distance being traversed five or even
seven times.</p>

<p>For the same reason that the men were ordered
to emblazon arms and crests on the backs of their
clothes, we had the boats which were to accompany
the sledges painted with gay and brilliant devices.
The rose, shamrock, and thistle were painted on the
hulls, and the royal arms decorated their sterns. Moss,
on this as on other occasions, was the artist; his great
difficulty in accomplishing the work being that in
spite of the quantity of turpentine with which the
paint was mixed, it persisted in freezing in the brush,
rendering that article more like a stick than an
artist&rsquo;s pencil.</p>

<p>The sledges were, of course, all named by their
commanders.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1n" id="ft1n" href="#fa1n"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The eight-men sledge has six uprights eighteen inches apart.
It is eleven feet long, three feet two inches wide, eleven inches
high, and weighs 130 lbs. complete. In former expeditions sails were
frequently used on the sledges to great advantage, when travelling
over smooth ice. But we were seldom so fortunate as to meet with
ice which was suitable for sailing, in any of our sledge journeys.
May and Egerton got their sledges under sail on an extensive floe
in Robeson Channel, when they crossed over to the Greenland side;
but as a rule the ice we met with was far too rough to make the
use of sails practicable. In rigging a sail on the sledge two tent
poles are lashed together as a yard, with a spare pole as a foot
yard. The other two tent poles are used as shears, and at their
ends a mast-head iron, or shear head, is fitted, consisting of two
rings united by a piece of iron about three inches long, from the
centre of which there is a hook on each side for the steadying guys,
and a small block for the halyards is seized on to the iron between
the rings. A spare cross-bar is placed on the top of the lading,
over the midship uprights, and lashed down to the bearer. It is
fitted with a span seized along its top-side, and the bights, with
a thimble in each, project just beyond the cross-bar. The ends of
the shears are then stepped into the thimbles attached to this cross-bar,
and the sail hoisted. On smooth ice, with the wind aft or on
the quarter, a sledge will travel under sail at a good pace. But
smooth ice was almost unknown in the region explored by our
expedition.</p>

<p><a name="ft2n" id="ft2n" href="#fa2n"><span class="fn">2</span></a> The tents were of light, close, unbleached duck. The eight-men
tents were nine feet four inches long at the bottom, and eight feet at
the top, seven feet wide and high, and weighed 44 lbs. The tent
ropes are six fathoms long of one and a quarter inch, and the tent
poles eight feet six inches long.</p>

<p><a name="ft3n" id="ft3n" href="#fa3n"><span class="fn">3</span></a> The medical stores for each sledge were:&mdash;2 phials of sal volatile
and aromatic spirits of ammonia; 2 phials of laudanum; 2 phials of
wine of opium; a small tin of Gregory&rsquo;s powders; 12 papers (10
grains each) of Dover&rsquo;s powders; 32 papers (15 grains each) of chalk
powders; 30 papers (4 grains each) of sugar of lead; a bottle of turpentine
liniment; a phial of carbolic acid; glycerine ointment; white
ointment; carbolic plaster; 4 dozen purgative pills; oil silk. Sponge,
pins, expanding splints, and carbolized tow, cotton wool, a catheter,
a tourniquet, a truss with pad, a lancet, twill, Persian gauze, 2 eye
shades, small splint, scissors, flannel ice goggles, tape, mustard, 3
calico bandages, 2 flannel bandages, and lint. These stores were in
a wooden case, and a medicine tin for bottles, together weighing
4 lbs.; while their contents weighed 7 lbs. 11 ozs., together, 12 lbs.</p>

<p><a name="ft4n" id="ft4n" href="#fa4n"><span class="fn">4</span></a> Our available force was much smaller than that of the expeditions
under Sir Horatio Austin (1850-51), and Sir Henry Kellet (1852-54).
They enjoyed the great advantage of having a third larger force&mdash;ninety
instead of sixty men.</p>

<p><a name="ft5n" id="ft5n" href="#fa5n"><span class="fn">5</span></a> The sledges for carrying boats have the two end cross-bars fitted
with two cleats, one on each side of the boat&rsquo;s keel. These cleats
are seven inches long, and are securely lashed to the cross-bars.
Two battens of American elm, each two inches wide and half an inch
thick, are lashed in a fore and aft direction to the top of the cross-bars
three and a half inches apart, that is to say one and three-quarters
inch on each side of the central bearer. They are sufficiently
long to allow of being secured to all the cross-bars. When the boat
is placed on the sledge the keel rests on the cross-bars between the
cleats, and is held in an upright position by one long cushion of stout
canvas, stuffed with cork cuttings, on each side, and these are kept
in their places by lashings.</p>

<p><a name="ft6n" id="ft6n" href="#fa6n"><span class="fn">6</span></a> As Sir Edward Parry&rsquo;s attempt to reach the Pole was the only
extended journey that was ever undertaken due north across the
Polar Sea, until the second attempt was made by the northern division
of sledges under my command, it will be well to give, in this place,
the details of Parry&rsquo;s equipment and the result of his expedition.</p>

<p>A Sir Edward Parry sailed from England in the &ldquo;Hecla,&rdquo; on April
3rd, 1827; when placing her in a safe harbour on the north coast
of Spitzbergen, he commenced his memorable attempt to reach the
Pole on June 21st. He had two boats, the &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Endeavour.&rdquo; Parry himself, with Mr. Beverley, was in the former,
James Ross and Edward Bird in the latter. Ten seamen and two
marines formed the crew of each boat. The boats were flat-bottomed,
with the extreme breadth of seven feet, carried well forward and
aft, and twenty feet long, the timbers of tough ash and hickory. On
the outside frame a system of planking was adopted with a view to
securing elasticity in the frequent concussions with the ice. This
consisted of a covering of waterproof canvas coated with tar, then
a thin fir plank, then a sheet of felt, and, lastly, a thin oak plank,
all secured to the timbers by iron screws. On each side of the keel
there was a strong runner shod with metal, like that of a sledge, on
which the boats entirely rested when on the ice. A hide span across
the fore-part of the runners had two horse-hair drag ropes attached
to it. The boats had two thwarts, a locker at each end, a light
framework along the sides for containing provisions and spare clothes,
a bamboo mast, and tanned duck sail, fourteen paddles, and a steer
oar. They started with seventy-one days&rsquo; provisions. The weight
of each boat was 1,539 lbs., and the total weight, with provisions,
3,753 lbs., or 268 lbs. per man; besides four light taboggan sledges
weighing 26 lbs. each. The daily allowance for each man was
10 ozs. of biscuit, 9 ozs. of pemmican, 1 oz. of cocoa, and 1 gill of
rum. Parry took no lime-juice. They slept in the boat with sails
as awnings, and travelled during the night.</p>

<p>They sailed in the boats until June 23rd, when it became necessary
to haul them on the ice in 81° 12&prime; 51&Prime; N. The actual travelling then
began over floes of small extent, intersected by hummocks. After
a journey of thirty days, Parry reached his most northern point on
July 23rd, in latitude, by dead reckoning, 82° 45&prime; N. No actual
observation for latitude was obtained at their extreme northern point.
They had travelled ninety-two miles over the ice, and two hundred
in the boats before they hauled them on to the floe, but were only
one hundred and seventy-two miles from the &ldquo;Hecla.&rdquo; Such had
been the drift of the floes to the southward. The boats returned to
the &ldquo;Hecla&rdquo; on August 21st, and Parry arrived in England again
on October 6th.</p>

<p>This journey was made in the middle of summer after the disruption
of the ice. The daily allowance of food for the men was insufficient,
and the weight of 26 lbs. for each man was too great. But these
were points which could only be learnt by experience, and Sir Edward
Parry was the pioneer of Arctic sledge travelling. He attained the
highest northern latitude ever before reached by man, and it was
forty-eight years and two months before any explorer succeeded
in going beyond the parallel which Parry reached in 1827.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">It</span> was a part of Captain Nares&rsquo;s scheme for the
spring campaign that, before the departure of the
extended parties, a dog sledge should be despatched
to communicate with our consort wintering some fifty
miles to the southward of us.</p>

<p>The officers and men of the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; were, of
course, in total ignorance of our position and even
of our safety, for no communication had taken place
between the two ships since the day of our departure
from Discovery Harbour, seven months before. As
soon as there was sufficient light to admit of travelling,
the important and necessary duty had to be undertaken
of conveying information to her respecting our
position, so that the anxiety of her people concerning
our safety might be relieved, and also that the
Captain of the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; might be made acquainted
with our intentions regarding the routes of
exploration allotted to our sledge travellers. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
parties from the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; would then adopt
other routes, and thus the area of unknown country
to he explored would be extended to the utmost limit
possible. The work of the expedition, consisting of
the journeys of the different parties from the two
ships, taking different routes, would thus embrace
all that human effort could achieve with the means
provided.</p>

<p>The duty of communicating with the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo;
was entrusted to Egerton; and Rawson, who was
naturally desirous of re-visiting his ship, was allowed
to accompany him. Their sledge was dragged by a
team of nine dogs, and the party was provisioned and
equipped for an absence of ten days. If they failed
in accomplishing their object in that time, and their
supplies became exhausted, they could replenish their
stock from the large depôt that had been established
during the previous autumn at a point about midway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>
between the two ships, in Lincoln Bay. Petersen,
the Danish interpreter, accompanied the two officers
in the capacity of dog driver.</p>

<p>In consequence of the very low temperature experienced
during the first week in March, their time
of departure had to be deferred. Sunday, the 12th
of March, was the day eventually selected for the start
of this the first sledging expedition of the season.</p>

<p>The temperature on that morning was low, but rose
gradually towards noon, until it seemed inclined to
remain stationary at 30° below zero.</p>

<p>There were further indications of a continuance of
fine weather, from the day being bright and clear and
the barometer steady. Letters to our friends on
board the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; were hastily finished. Immediately
divine service had been performed the
colours were hoisted, and amidst the cheers of &ldquo;all
hands,&rdquo; who had assembled on the floe to bid the
travellers God speed, H.M. sledge &ldquo;Clements Markham,&rdquo;
with its bright standard fluttering out bravely
before a light breeze, started with the object of
renewing intercourse with our comrades in the
&ldquo;Discovery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the next two or three days our thoughts on
board were constantly with the absent ones, especially
as the temperature, shortly after their departure, had
again fallen very low. This, however, caused us little
uneasiness, for we knew that everything that lay in
our power had been done to protect them from any
sudden and extreme cold, and we all had the greatest
confidence in the skill, discretion, and sound judgment
of our two messmates. Many a silent prayer
was offered up in their behalf, that they might accomplish
their mission in safety, and return speedily with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
good news of those who, like ourselves, were wintering
in the ice.</p>

<p>On the third day they returned unexpectedly with a
sad tale of woe and suffering, and with the poor Dane
utterly prostrate and helpless on the sledge. I cannot
do better than relate the sad story in Lieutenant
Egerton&rsquo;s own words.</p>

<p>We read in his official report, that not five hours
after they had left the ship &ldquo;frost-bites became so
numerous, that I thought it advisable to encamp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was only the beginning of the story, for they
appear to have passed a comparatively comfortable
night.</p>

<p>At any rate they were up early the next morning
and again under weigh; at about one o&rsquo;clock, when
they halted for lunch, Petersen complained of cramp
in his stomach and was given some hot tea. He had
no appetite, which perhaps was as well, for we read of
the bacon, which is always used for lunch, &ldquo;We were
unable to eat it, being frozen so hard that we could
not get our teeth through the lean.&rdquo; They still continued
their journey, encountering some very rough
travelling, which necessitated severe physical labour
on the part of the two officers. &ldquo;The dogs were of
little or no use in getting across these slopes, as it
was impossible to get them to go up the cliff, and
Petersen being unable to work, Lieutenant Rawson
and I had to get the sledge along as best we could.&rdquo;
Towards the end of the day we read: &ldquo;Petersen
began to get rather worse, and was shivering all over,
his nose being constantly frost-bitten, and at times
taking five or ten minutes before the circulation could
be thoroughly restored. Lieutenant Rawson had
several small frost-bites, and I escaped with only
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span></p>

<p>On halting for the night, directly the tent was
pitched they sent Petersen inside with strict injunctions
to shift his foot gear and get into his sleeping-bag,
whilst they busied themselves in preparing
supper and attending to the dogs; but when they
entered the tent, they found &ldquo;that he had turned in
without shifting his foot gear, was groaning a good
deal, and complaining of cramp in the stomach and
legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having made him change, they gave him some tea,
and then administered a few drops of sal volatile,
which appeared to give the poor fellow a little ease.</p>

<p>The next morning the wind was so high and their
patient in such a weak state that they did not think
it prudent to attempt a start. He had passed a very
restless night, and still complained very much of
cramp.</p>

<p>Later in the day he appeared to get worse, &ldquo;shaking
and shivering all over and breathing in short gasps.
His face, hands, and feet were all frost-bitten, the
latter severely, and he had pains in his side as well.&rdquo;
After restoring the circulation they rubbed him with
warm flannels and placed one of their comforters
round his stomach.</p>

<p>In such a wretched state was the poor fellow that
they agreed it would endanger his life if they proceeded
on their journey; and that when the weather
moderated the only course they could pursue was to
return with all haste to their ship.</p>

<p>As it was impossible to keep their patient warm in
the tent, these two young officers burrowed a hole in
a snow-drift, and into this cavity they transported the
sick man, themselves, and all their tent robes, closing
the aperture by placing over it the tent and sledge.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
They deprived themselves of their own clothing for
the benefit of the invalid, whose frozen feet they
actually placed inside their clothes in direct contact
with their bodies, until their own heat was extracted
and they were themselves severely frost-bitten in
various parts. The poor fellow was now in a very
low state; he could retain neither food nor liquid.
&ldquo;About 6 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> he was very bad; this time worse
than before. There appeared to be no heat in him of
any kind whatever, and he had acute pains in the
stomach and back. We chafed him on the stomach,
hands, face, and feet, and when he got better wrapped
him up in everything warm we could lay our hands
upon,&rdquo; namely, their own clothing, which they could
ill afford to lose; but they entirely forgot their own
condition in their endeavours to ameliorate that of
their comrade. Lighting their spirit lamp and carefully
closing every crevice by which the cold air could
enter, they succeeded in raising the temperature of
the interior to 7°; but &ldquo;the atmosphere in the hut
became somewhat thick!&rdquo; This was, however, preferable
to the intense cold. Let us follow the story
out, and learn how nobly these two officers tended
their sick and suffering companion. &ldquo;We were constantly
asking if he was warm in his feet and hands,
to which he replied in the affirmative; but before
making him comfortable&rdquo; (fancy being <i>comfortable</i>
under such circumstances!) &ldquo;for the night, we
examined his feet, and found them both perfectly
gelid and hard from the toes to the ankle, his hands
nearly as bad. So each taking a foot we set to work
to warm them with our hands and flannels, as each
hand and flannel got cold <i>warming them about our
persons</i>, and also lit up the spirit lamp. In about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
two hours we got his feet to, and put them in warm
foot gear, cut his bag down to allow him more room
to move in, and then wrapped him up in the spare
coverlet. His hands we also brought round and
bound them up in flannel wrappers, with mitts over
all. Gave him some warm tea and a little rum and
water, which he threw up. Shortly after I found him
eating snow, which we had strictly forbidden once or
twice before. In endeavouring to do this again during
the night, he dragged his feet out of the covering;
but only a few minutes could have elapsed before
this was detected by Lieutenant Rawson, who, upon
examining his feet, found them in much the same
state as before. We rubbed and chafed them again
for over an hour, and when circulation was restored
wrapped him up again, and so passed the third
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The patience and endurance of the two officers are
beyond all praise. It is difficult to realize the misery
of that night. Wearied with the severe physical exertions
of the two previous days, having their own
meals to prepare and the dogs to look after, they had
to pass a sleepless and anxious night in their endeavours
to keep life in the body of their half-frozen
comrade.</p>

<p>On the following morning Petersen appeared to be
slightly better, so thinking it was preferable to run
the risk of taking him back as he was, than to pass
such another night as the last, they put him on the
sledge, and, having hurriedly eaten their breakfast,
they started for the ship with all despatch. They
had a rough journey before them of eighteen miles;
but they knew it was a case of life and death, and
they encouraged the dogs to their utmost speed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
dogs, being homeward bound, were willing enough
and needed little persuasion, so that, for a time, they
rattled along at a good pace. But actual progress
could not have been very rapid, for we read in Egerton&rsquo;s
report that the patient&rsquo;s &ldquo;circulation was so
feeble that his face and hands were constantly frost-bitten,
entailing frequent stoppages whilst we endeavoured
to restore the affected parts.&rdquo; The difficulties
of the homeward journey may be gathered from the
following extracts: &ldquo;On arriving at the Black Cape
we had to take the patient off the sledge, and while
one assisted him round, the other kept the dogs back,
for by this time they knew they were homeward bound,
and required no small amount of trouble to hold in.
After getting the sledge round and restoring Petersen&rsquo;s
hands and nose (which were almost as bad again a
few minutes after), and securing him on the sledge,
we again set off. At the next cape the same difficulties
were experienced, in fact rather more, for the
sledge took charge down a &lsquo;ditch,&rsquo;<a name="fa1o" id="fa1o" href="#ft1o"><span class="sp">1</span></a> about twenty-five
feet deep, turning right over three times in its descent,
and out of which we had to drag it, and while clearing
harness (which employed us both, one to stand in
front of the dogs with the whip, while the other
cleared the lines), the dogs made a sudden bolt past
Lieutenant Rawson, who was in front with the whip,
and dragged me more than a hundred yards before we
could stop them. At length, after the usual process
with Petersen (that of thawing his hands and nose,
which we did every time we cleared harness, or it was
actually necessary to stop), we got away, thankful that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
our troubles were over. The dogs got their harness
into a dreadful entanglement in their excitement to
get home; but we were afraid to clear them lest they
should break away from us, or cause us any delay, as
we were both naturally anxious to return with the
utmost speed to the ship, and so relieve ourselves of
the serious responsibility occasioned by the very precarious
state in which our patient was lying. Upon
arriving alongside at 6.30 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, we were very thankful
that Petersen was able to answer us when we informed
him he was at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor fellow! it was the last home he ever reached
alive, for in two short months his remains were
carried from the ship and laid in their last resting-place
in this world, on the summit of a low hill
overlooking the scene of his last sledge journey! In
conclusion, Egerton says, &ldquo;I regret exceedingly that
I have been compelled to return to the ship without
having accomplished my journey to H.M.S. &lsquo;Discovery;&rsquo;
but I trust that what I have done will meet
with your approval, and that the course I adopted
may be the means of having lessened the very serious
and distressing condition of Petersen.&rdquo; Gallant
fellow! of course his doings meet not only with the
approval but the admiration of all Englishmen who
take pride in the noble and heroic deeds of their countrymen.
The work of these two brave young officers
on this occasion stands out conspicuously amongst
the many deeds of daring and devotion with which
the annals of Arctic adventure abound.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that during the time they
were away the sun had only just made its reappearance,
and was therefore at a very low altitude, so that
little benefit could be derived from its rays; and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>
only afforded sufficient light to enable the travellers to
keep on the march for about eight or nine hours a
day.<a name="fa2o" id="fa2o" href="#ft2o"><span class="sp">2</span></a> On the 20th of March, five days after the
return from their calamitous journey, the same two
officers made another and a more successful start.
On this occasion they were accompanied by a couple
of sailors, and their sledge was dragged by a team of
seven dogs. In five days, after a severe and toilsome
journey, rendered doubly so by the extreme cold and
the heavy nature of the road over which they had to
travel, they reached the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; conveying to
her officers and crew the pleasing intelligence of our
safety, and receiving in return an account of the
happy winter passed by them.</p>

<p>Poor Petersen never recovered from the effects of
this journey. He rallied a little after he arrived on
board, and was placed under the tender and skilful
treatment of Dr. Colan, who for some time held out
slight hopes of his recovery; but the injuries he had
received were of too serious a nature to admit of much
hope, and he gradually sank until he expired peacefully
on the 14th of May. Perhaps it was better that
it should be so, for the poor fellow would not only
have been disfigured by losing portions of his nose
and ears, but he would also have been a cripple,
for the doctor had been compelled to amputate both
his feet in order to stop the mortification from extending.
These frost-bites are indeed very dreadful, and
must always be quickly taken in hand so as to avoid
any serious result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span></p>

<p>So cold were the frozen limbs of poor Petersen, that
his companions said it was like touching cold steel,
and produced frost-bite almost as rapidly as if they
were really touching a piece of metal!</p>

<p>Although this chapter is rather a mournful one,
and has a very melancholy termination, I make no
apology for having devoted it entirely to our first
sledging expedition of the season, believing that my
readers will feel both pride and pleasure in hearing of
the noble conduct of my two messmates.</p>

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">On</span> the morning of Monday, the 3rd of April, an
unwonted bustle and excitement on board and around
the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; betokened that something unusual was
taking place. Men in their travelling costumes might
have been observed busily engaged in adding the last
finishing touches to the already well-packed sledges.
Officers, also in travelling attire, were carefully conveying
delicate instruments from the ship to the row
of sledges drawn up in &ldquo;line of battle&rdquo; on the floe,
whilst the white ensign flying from the peak bore
witness of some important event.</p>

<p>The day was indeed one of memorable import, for
it was the one that we had all, during the long dark
winter, looked forward to as that on which our real
work was to commence. It was the day on which we
were to start forth with the object of achieving all
that was possible with the means at our disposal, in
the great and glorious work of increasing the stock
of geographical knowledge respecting the Polar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
regions. No wonder, then, that the scene of our
winter quarters presented an animated and unwonted
appearance on that bright but intensely cold morning.</p>

<p>The sledges, seven in number, on two of which were
placed the boats to accompany the northern division,
were drawn up in single line, one before the other,
according to the seniority of their respective leaders.
They were all fully equipped and provisioned, and
were &ldquo;manned&rdquo; by a force of fifty-three officers and
men; a chosen band, eager to emulate the deeds of
their predecessors, and willing to risk their lives in
bringing to a successful issue the task they had resolved
to accomplish.</p>

<p>A strict medical examination had been held a day
or two previously, and the rather unnecessary
question, &ldquo;Do you feel yourself fit and able in every
way to go sledging?&rdquo; was put to all. It is needless
to record the answer!</p>

<p>On the previous day, being Sunday, Pullen preached
a capital sermon, drawing comparisons between the
undertaking in which we were about to engage, and
the march of the Israelites to the Promised Land.
The hymn &ldquo;for those at sea&rdquo; was sung and the Holy
Communion celebrated, at which latter service there
was an exceptionally good attendance, the number
of communicants amongst the men having largely
increased.</p>

<p>From each sledge flew the bright colours of its
commander&rsquo;s standard: a swallow-tailed flag bearing
the armorial colours, and emblazoned with the crest
of its owner, each charged with the red cross of St.
George. In addition, the two boats displayed from
their mast-heads Captain Nares&rsquo;s Union Jack and
a white ensign. Worked by the fair hands of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>
loved and cherished one at home, these standards,
as they fluttered out bravely before a gentle breeze,
kindled our enthusiasm, whilst they materially added
to the spirit and gaiety of the scene.</p>

<p>The sledges were arranged in the following order:&mdash;&ldquo;Marco
Polo&rdquo; (with a boat), &ldquo;Challenger,&rdquo; &ldquo;Victoria&rdquo;
(with a boat), &ldquo;Poppie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bulldog,&rdquo; &ldquo;Alexandra,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Bloodhound;&rdquo; the latter was only a
small sledge party ordered to accompany us for three
or four days, then supply us with three days&rsquo; provisions,
and return to the ship to report our progress.</p>

<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock, everything being in readiness for
a start, all hands assembled on the floe, and prayers
were read by Pullen. The hymn, &ldquo;God, from whom
all blessings flow,&rdquo; was then sung, after which the
order was given to &ldquo;fall in,&rdquo; and, amidst the hearty
cheers of those few who were left behind, the sledging
parties moved off. The captain and officers accompanied
us for a short distance, when, wishing us Godspeed,
they turned to go back. This was a signal for
three cheers from the travellers, after which they
settled down to their work, and the march was steadily
commenced.</p>

<p>The first day&rsquo;s march was necessarily a short one.
It was to many their introduction to the &ldquo;drag-ropes,&rdquo;
and symptoms of fatigue were soon detected, caused
by the energetic exertions of the inexperienced, who,
unlike the veterans of the previous autumn, overtaxed
their strength in their ardour to perform a good day&rsquo;s
work.</p>

<p>The temperature at starting was 33° below zero,
and at this it remained steady the whole day, rendering
the task of writing up our journals when we halted
extremely unpleasant and painful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span></p>

<p>The scene of our first encampment was an animated
and picturesque one. We had marched about six
miles from the ship, and the site selected was at the
base of a low brow, forming a connection or isthmus
between a long projecting tongue and the mainland.
Here we pitched our seven tents, from each of which
the smoke from the cooking utensils issued, ascending
in spiral columns until lost amidst the clouds. In
our rear were the snow-clad hills, whilst in front was
the illimitable frozen sea. Men hurried about in
the execution of various duties incidental to &ldquo;pitching
for the night,&rdquo; such as the issuing of provisions by
the several sledge-captains, the banking up with snow
of the exterior of the tents, the re-packing of the
sledges, or the careful covering up of the lading so as
to ensure its protection from snow-drift; all of which
duties must be sedulously carried out before rest and
repose can be sought in the sleeping-bags. A pleasing
aroma of cooking tea was mixed with the fragrance
of stewed pemmican, and made us smack our lips in
anticipation of the meal that was preparing.</p>

<p>Not the least hard part of a day&rsquo;s work is that of
camping after a toilsome and weary journey, especially
when the temperature is low and a cold sleepless
night anticipated; but when the weather is warm
enough to obtain a good night&rsquo;s rest, the order to halt
is always received with very great satisfaction, more
especially when a good day&rsquo;s work has been accomplished,
with the prospect of fair travelling on the
morrow.</p>

<p>As soon as the tents are ready for the reception of
the men, they enter one by one, take off their &ldquo;overalls&rdquo;
for which their duffel coats are substituted,
change their foot gear and get into their sleeping-bags.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
This change of foot gear in the morning and
evening is the whole extent of the toilet performed by
the sledgers until their return to the ship!</p>

<p>The following morning we were under weigh pretty
early, having spent a cold wretched night, only too
glad to be up and doing something, the temperature
inside our tent, with all the men in their bags, being
as low as 15° below zero. The experience gained
during the autumn had a very salutary effect on the
travellers, the apprehension even of frost-bite being in
itself sufficient to banish all idea of sleep.</p>

<p>The operation of dressing and undressing, although
it is entirely limited to the clothing of the feet, is
without doubt one of the most disagreeable duties
connected with sledge travelling. Our hose and
blanket-wrappers, although they were invariably kept
<i>inside</i> our sleeping-bags during the night, were frozen
so hard in the morning that they were with the
greatest difficulty folded over our feet. Sometimes
the wrappers were tied round the knees at night-time
to protect them from the cold, for that part of our
body seemed more sensitive to the temperature than
any other.</p>

<p>Not the least trying part of our toilet was lacing
and tying the stiffly frozen strings of our equally hard
moccasins with fingers either aching from cold or
devoid of all sensation. Not only was this a very
painful operation, but it was one that sorely taxed
and ruffled the equanimity of our tempers.</p>

<p>The snow over which we travelled was very soft
and, unfortunately for us, was also very deep, making
the dragging with our heavily laden sledges most
laborious, in fact so much so that we were frequently
compelled to resort to &ldquo;double banking;&rdquo; that is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
say, the two crews would be employed in first dragging
on one sledge and then return to advance the other.
This, of course, made our progress very slow. After
the long confinement of the men during the darkness
of the winter, they were, in spite of the careful attention
that had been paid to daily exercise, hardly in
what might be called first-rate condition, so that
fatigue for the first few days was felt by the majority,
and not wishing to impose too much on their zealous
desire to push on, short journeys were in consequence
performed.</p>

<p>On the second day out, the temperature fell to 45°
below zero, or 77° below freezing point. The cold
then was so intense as to deprive us of sleep, the
temperature <i>inside</i> the tent being as low as -25°,
the whole period of rest being occupied in attempting
to keep the blood in circulation. Several frost-bites
were sustained, but they were all attended to in time,
and resulted in nothing worse than severe and very
uncomfortable blisters.</p>

<p>So hard were our tent robes and sleeping-bags
frozen that they resembled sheet-iron, and care had
to be taken to prevent them from coming into contact
with the face, for an abrasion of the skin would undoubtedly
follow!</p>

<p>Our curry paste, a small quantity of which we used
to mix with our pemmican to make it more palateable,
looked, as the cook of the day observed, exactly like a
piece of brass, and was equally hard. Cramp in the
legs was complained of by many during the first few
nights, but gradually wore off, having in all probability
been induced by the severe and unaccustomed
exercise. Thirst was also a subject of complaint,
and this, except at meal times, it was impossible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
alleviate; for although each man was supplied with a
tin water-bottle covered with duffel, the water could
not be prevented from freezing, in spite of the bottles
being kept inside the waistbands of the men&rsquo;s trousers.
The practice of quenching thirst by putting snow or
ice into the mouth is a very dangerous one and was
never permitted.</p>

<p>On the fourth day out we parted with our little
sledge, the &ldquo;Bloodhound,&rdquo; which, having fulfilled its
mission, returned to the ship, taking back one of our
party, who appeared unable to stand the fatigues of
sledging, and leaving one of their crew to fill his
vacancy. We were thus able to send back intelligence
of our progress so far, and to report the health of the
men to be satisfactory, and that all were in capital
spirits. On the 10th of April the six sledges in company
arrived at the depôt of provisions established
near Cape Joseph Henry during the autumn, and
found it undisturbed. The remainder of that day
was employed in bringing the provisions off to the
sledges, which were left on the ice, and in distributing
them. The next morning was thick and foggy, the
atmosphere being rendered doubly obscure by a heavy
fall of snow.</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;The cold, uncomfortable daylight dawned,</p>
<p class="i05">And the white tents, topping a low ground fog,</p>
<p class="i05">Show&rsquo;d like a fleet becalmed.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>On this day the supporting sledges &ldquo;Bulldog&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Alexandra,&rdquo; having performed the duties allotted to
them, bade farewell to their companions and returned
to their ship. The two extended parties advanced on
their solitary missions; the northern division leaving
the land and pushing straight out on the rugged polar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
pack, whilst the western party continued the exploration
of the coast to the westward.</p>

<p>It was a strange farewell that was taken on that
cold dull day on the inhospitable ice-floe, amidst
bristling hummocks and heaped up snow-drifts, as
the several parties pursued their different courses, one
returning to their Arctic home, the others to unknown
difficulties, but to hoped-for discoveries.</p>

<p>Brief was the parting, but sincere were the wishes
for each other&rsquo;s success. Hearty British cheers resounded
in that icy wilderness, hitherto undisturbed
by the presence of mortal man, as we bade adieu to
our fellow-travellers, the echoes from which had
scarce died away before their forms vanished from
our view in the thick driving snow that shrouded in
obscurity the surrounding objects.</p>

<p>It was, however, no time for reflection; for now all
our energies, both mental and physical, had to be
devoted to the furtherance of the great work with
which we were entrusted. The men resolutely seized
their drag-ropes, and with light and willing hearts
commenced their toilsome advance.</p>

<p>In order to enable my readers to follow us during
the time we were engaged in the sledging operations,
I will endeavour to explain, as briefly as possible, the
ordinary daily routine invariably carried out by those
so employed belonging to the &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cook for the day is an important personage,
and his duties, as I have before related, are of a very
onerous and trying description. Each individual
composing the sledge crew has to perform this office
in turn during twenty-four hours, and it is one that
sorely taxes his patience and powers of endurance,
especially in very cold weather. He gladly transfers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
his functions as cook to his successor, happy in the
assurance that his &ldquo;turn&rdquo; will not come round for
another week, unless sickness or any other unforeseen
event should prostrate any of his comrades.</p>

<p>The cook&rsquo;s work commences at an early hour, when,
after having lighted his lamp and converted sufficient
ice or snow into water for the morning meal, he reenters
the tent, and walking unconcernedly on the
sleeping forms of his companions, proceeds deliberately
to brush from the top and sides of the tent
the condensed moisture that has been accumulating
during the night, and which falls in minute frozen
particles on the coverlet. This operation being concluded,
to the no small relief of those over whom
he has been walking, the coverlet is removed, well
brushed, shaken, folded up, and placed on the sledge.
He then busies himself with the important preparations
for breakfast. In about two hours from the
time that the cook is called, the cocoa is reported
ready, when the rest of the party are awakened.</p>

<p>If the weather is very cold, breakfast is discussed
in our bags, in which we all sit up; a comical-looking
lot in our grey skull-caps and duffel coats! The
biscuit bag is then laid in the centre of the tent,
spoons are produced, and the pannikins, each containing
one pint of warm cocoa, are handed in. The
only articles that were not considered as common
property amongst us were our spoons. These were
slightly larger than an ordinary table-spoon, were
made of horn, and supplied to each sledger by a
beneficent Government. We generally carried them
slung round our necks by laniards, or in our pockets.</p>

<p>The pannikins being emptied they are returned to
the cook, who has in the mean time been preparing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
the pemmican. So hard is this article frozen that
the portions for use have to be chipped off with a
chopper before they can be put into the stew-pan.</p>

<p>While the cook&rsquo;s anxiety is momentarily increased
by the fear that his fuel will be consumed before the
repast is prepared, and his fingers are alternately
burnt and frost-bitten in his endeavours to trim and
adjust the lamp, prayers are read to those inside, the
foot gear is changed and the sleeping-bags rolled up.
By the time this has been done, the pemmican is
ready, passed in, and eaten. Orders are then given
to strike tent, pack sledge, and prepare to march.</p>

<p>The great secret in packing a sledge properly is
to have the weights as nearly as possible in the centre&mdash;as
far from the extremes as it is possible to get
them, so that the sledge may rise easily over obstacles.
When all is ready, the drag-ropes are manned, and
with a &ldquo;one, two, three, haul,&rdquo; and a good pull
altogether, the sledge is started and the march
commenced.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to scrape the pannikins out
with a knife, before the refuse inside has time to
freeze, otherwise it will be difficult to remove. Water
for washing purposes, of any description, whilst
sledging is quite out of the question. After marching
for about five or six hours, a halt is called for lunch.
This meal consists of four ounces of bacon, a little
biscuit, and a warm pannikin of tea to each man.</p>

<p>Although the most refreshing and enjoyable of all
our meals, luncheon was, when there was much wind,
or the weather intensely cold, a very trying one. The
halt is of necessity long. Frequently an hour or an
hour and a half elapses before the tea is reported
ready, during which time the men are compelled to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
keep constantly on the move to avoid frost-bites.
When there is much wind the tent is pitched; but
this adds little to our comfort, for it is too cold to
remain inside for any length of time. If we were
not all suffering from the same cause, we should be
disposed to laugh at the strange antics of our companions
in their efforts to keep their feet from getting
frost-bitten. One man is &ldquo;marking time&rdquo; at the
double; another jumping up and down in a frantic
manner; another is sitting down cross-legged like
a Turk, or a tailor, and is occupied in belabouring
his feet with his mittened hands, in his energetic
endeavours to restore circulation; whilst another,
unable any longer to endure the cold, commences
furiously to kick the sledge, or a hummock, with both
feet like one bereft of his senses. Although halted,
little rest is enjoyed; anxiously is the kettle watched,
and many are the tender inquiries concerning the
state of the water inside. &ldquo;Does it boil?&rdquo; is a
question frequently asked, and unless the cook is
blessed with an amiable disposition, the perversity
of the kettle is sufficient, at times, to drive him
almost distracted. The old saw, &ldquo;A watched pot
never boils,&rdquo; is fully exemplified. At length, to the
relief and delight of all, the announcement is made
that the tea is ready, when all troubles are forgotten
in the pleasure and enjoyment of a warm pannikin
of tea. Sometimes little difficulties would arise in
consequence of the haste with which it was necessary
to prepare and discuss this meal. These, although
serious at the time, served afterwards to amuse, and
were soon forgotten. On one occasion, the water
having been boiled, and the cook having, as he
thought, carefully added the tea and sugar, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
were as carefully stirred up, the allowance of tea was
served out and eagerly drunk by the wearied sledgers,
who were only too glad and thankful to receive anything
warm. It was not until some time after the
allowance had been consumed that the cook discovered
he had omitted to put in the <i>tea</i>, and had served out
simply a decoction of warm water and brown sugar!
Sometimes the tea was made from salt-water ice, the
cook having inadvertently mixed it before tasting the
water! In such a case we had either to drink it, or
get none at all!</p>

<p>Our bacon was, as a rule, frozen so hard as to be
like a piece of granite, and it was only by thawing it
in our warm tea that it became eatable. This had
the effect of converting our tea into a sort of soup!</p>

<p>The time of halting for the night varied considerably;
but it was generally after ten, eleven, and
sometimes twelve hours&rsquo; steady marching. The first
thing to be done is to select a suitable site as level as
possible and where the snow is not too deep, for
pitching the tent, which should be carefully banked
up outside with snow to the height of two or three
feet. Every one assists in this work except the cook,
who is busily engaged in the necessary preparations
for the evening meal. As soon as the tent is ready,
the men enter, change their foot gear, and struggle
into their half-frozen bags, their toes and feet having
previously been examined by the officer for the detection
of frost-bites. If a frost-bite is discovered,
circulation is immediately restored, and the injured
part dressed by the application of a little glycerine
ointment and some lint.</p>

<p>As a rule the moccasins, hose, and blanket wrappers
are so firmly frozen together that they are with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
difficulty separated, and are taken off the feet as <i>one</i>
article of clothing. It is amusing to witness the
frantic exertions made by some of the men in their
efforts to struggle into their duffel coats. They are
frozen so stiff and hard that this operation is always
an intensely aggravating one, and even when it is
accomplished, the men are utterly helpless until the
warmth from their bodies has partially thawed the
coats and rendered them supple. They were, with a
very great deal of truth, likened to &ldquo;strait-jackets.&rdquo;</p>

<tr><td class="caption">GETTING READY TO &ldquo;BAG.&rdquo;</td></tr></table>

<p>By the time that the whole party are comfortably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
settled in their bags, supper, consisting of tea and
pemmican, is ready and served; after which pipes are
lighted, conversation ensues, and the allowance of
grog is served out. This is undoubtedly the most
delightful and happiest part of the day&rsquo;s proceedings,
and I should deprecate very strongly any attempts
to deprive the poor Arctic sledger of his small modicum
of rum and water, provided it was always issued at
the same time as ours, and <i>never</i> during the fatigue
and exertions of the day. The quantity is so small
that the most fanatical theorist cannot seriously
maintain that it can do harm. But experience proves
that it tends very materially to cheer and invigorate
the men during the short time that they can really
call their own in the whole twenty-four hours, and
it certainly imparts a glow which induces sleep&mdash;a
very important effect of its use. Sometimes singing
will be the order of the day, or rather evening, or
perhaps a book will be read aloud; but whatever
amusement is resorted to for the purpose of thoroughly
enjoying the half-hour after supper, whether it is
singing, reading, or yarning, all are cheerful, contented,
and happy.</p>

<p>Home is, of course, a great topic of conversation,
and what each man intends doing on his return to
England is freely discussed. We know all about
each other, and frequently detect ourselves confiding
secrets that we should under ordinary circumstances
divulge only to our bosom friends. Sometimes a hot
argument is maintained between two men belonging
to different counties on the relative merits of the pigs
of their own counties and their manner of feeding;
or perhaps they will get into a discussion on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span>
liberality of large landed proprietors near whom they
may be living. For instance, one man who lived in
Devonshire was extolling Lord Mount Edgcumbe.
&ldquo;Ah! he was a noble lord! he opened his grounds
once a week for the admission of the public.&rdquo; But
another man, hailing from Lancashire, answered by
saying, &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t see that he was any better than
any other lord; for,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Lord Derby admitted
the public into his park every day, and if it was
raining he would send his carriage for you!&rdquo; This
argument, although I fear not strictly correct, was
unanswerable, and the west countryman had to give
in to the more liberal experiences of his friend.</p>

<p>Before composing ourselves to sleep, the cook,
having made the necessary preparations for the
morning&rsquo;s meal, passes in our coverlet. This is
always the last thing done before closing the door
of the tent for the night.</p>

<p>How is it possible to describe what this coverlet
is like when handed in? Those who have never been
initiated into the mysteries of Arctic sledge life would
be unable to realize what it resembles when unpacked
from the sledge. It is more like a piece of wood or
sheet-iron than an article of woollen material. With
the utmost difficulty it is unfolded; but as for spreading,
that is quite out of the question: it stands up in
the centre like a second tent, and refuses to lie flat,
in spite of the beating with which it is assailed. It
is only after it has been some time in this position
that it gradually thaws, when it becomes a &ldquo;wet
blanket&rdquo; indeed!</p>

<p>The contents of this chapter may give some idea of
the ordinary routine of a sledge traveller&rsquo;s life. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
details were invariably carried out by the different
sledge parties despatched from the &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo; In the
succeeding chapter we will follow the fortunes of the
northern division, and I shall endeavour to depict
briefly the difficulties it had to contend with, and the
manner in which they were surmounted.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> different sledge parties having branched off, as
related in the preceding chapter, I must request my
readers to follow the fortunes of the northern division,
which was under my command.</p>

<p>The serious obstacles that so persistently impeded
our progress were immediately encountered. The
retreating forms of our comrades, who had assisted
us thus far, were scarcely out of sight before we were
busily engaged in constructing a road along which to
drag our sledges. These roads were rendered necessary
in consequence of the rugged nature of the ice
over which we had to travel, the floes being of the
smallest dimensions as regarded superficial area, and
surrounded by broad fringes of squeezed-up hummocks.
The hummocks proved most formidable impediments
to our advance. No sooner had we congratulated
ourselves upon successfully accomplishing
a passage through one line of these obstacles, than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
another, and perhaps a more ragged and apparently
impassable hedge, appeared in front of us. It seemed
as if a terrible conflict had been fought between these
ponderous masses of ice, which had so shattered and
split them up as to suggest to us the idea that they
resembled a tempestuous broken sea suddenly frozen.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:765px; height:1302px" src="images/img300.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span></p>

<p>To make any advance at all, pickaxes and shovels
were in constant requisition, and with these implements
we succeeded in hewing and cutting a road for
our sledges, by which we were able to make a snail-like
progress. The roughness of the road was not
our only difficulty. Around and about the hummocks
the snow had drifted to such a depth that the men
were frequently floundering in it up to their waists,
and passages through this had to be cleared with
shovels before the sledges could be dragged on. Occasionally
the sledges would have to be unpacked and
lightened considerably before they could be dragged
through this deep soft snow.</p>

<p>We, at first, attempted to console ourselves with
the idea that this irregular and broken sea of ice was
only caused by our proximity to the land; and that
we should, as we advanced in a northerly direction,
meet with smooth level floes, on which we should be
able to travel along merrily, and so make up for the
time expended in struggling through the hummocks.</p>

<p>How delusive proved our hopes and anticipations
the sequel will show! The belts of hummocks that
separated the floes varied from twenty yards to half a
mile in breadth, and were from fifteen to fifty feet in
height.</p>

<p>Road-making, as we called it, was a work of daily,
I may say of constant, occurrence. We regarded our
pickaxes with great affection, and they were consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
treated with the utmost tenderness and care.
Any mishap to them would have been indeed a serious
misfortune, as we should have nothing to supply their
place, and would therefore have been in a predicament
in which we could neither advance nor return.
The anxiety with which they were watched may
therefore be imagined.</p>

<p>Instead of giving simply a brief <i>résumé</i> of our
sledging life, it will, I think, be more interesting to
follow the sledge parties day by day in their arduous
march to the northward, and their still more irksome
and wearisome return journey. To do this, it will be
as well to extract portions from my daily journal,
avoiding repetition as much as possible, and commencing
on the day after that on which we were left
by our supporting sledges to prosecute our undertaking.</p>

<p><i>April 12th.</i>&mdash;A most gratifying and unexpected
change of weather enabled us to pass a comparatively
comfortable night, the temperature inside our tent
being as high as +16°. Hitherto it has stood at,
and generally far below, zero. With the thermometer
in the air registering a few degrees below zero, it is
just possible to keep ourselves warm enough inside
our tents to sleep; but with a temperature ranging
from -35° downwards sleep is almost out of the
question.</p>

<p>In order to keep the sun as much as possible at our
backs during the time we were on the march, we
adopted the system of travelling, whilst on our outward
journey, between noon and midnight. The
cooks were, as a rule, called at about half-past nine
in the forenoon, and the sledges were generally on the
move about half-past eleven. This time of travelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span>
was selected more with a view to the prevention of
snow blindness than anything else.</p>

<p>After breakfast the road-makers, six in number,
were advanced for the purpose of constructing a road
through an ugly fringe of hummocks on the southern
side of which our camp had been pitched; the rest
of the party being employed in striking the tents,
packing and bringing on the sledges, one by one, as
far as the road was practicable. Being a bright sunny
day the tent robes and other gear were triced up to
the boats&rsquo; masts and yards to dry. The sun was
powerful enough to extract the moisture from the
woollen substance, which would freeze, forming a
sort of hoar-frost that could with ease be brushed or
shaken off.</p>

<p>On these bright clear days, the snow on the surface
of the floes over which we were journeying was so
highly crystallized that it sparkled and glittered with
the most brilliant iridescent colours. The ground
upon which we trod appeared to be strewn with bright
and lustrous gems, of which the most prominent were
diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires. It was
indeed a fairy-like scene; but our duties were too
matter of fact to admit of our indulging for any time
in romance or sentiment.</p>

<p>A glance at our comrades would quickly recall us
to the reality of our situation. Their dirty and rough-clad
forms were strangely at variance with the scene
of enchantment that might be conjured up. With
faces scarified by the combined action of sun and
frost, and black with smoke, with the tips of their
fingers senseless from repeated frost-bites, with sore
shoulders and aching limbs, the wearied sledgers
pursued their way, not altogether indifferent to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
beauties that surrounded them, but careless of the
difficulties and discomforts they encountered.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, being about three miles from
the nearest land, we observed, to our surprise, the
fresh traces on the snow of a little lemming! It is
hard to tell what inducement this little animal could
have had for straying so far away from the land, and
consequently from its means of obtaining the wherewithal
to support life!</p>

<p>We passed through a dense mass of hummocks,
emerging, eventually, on a heavy floe of &ldquo;ancient
lineage,&rdquo; whose surface was undulating, and adorned
with veritable &ldquo;ice-mountains&rdquo; some twenty feet in
height. These were generally of a rounded form and
of a smooth surface, and appeared to be the result of
long and continuous snow-drift. We camped on the
northern edge of the floe, the men being employed in
cutting a road through the hummocks whilst supper
was preparing, in readiness for our start on the
morrow.</p>

<p>A journey through, and over, hummocks is the
most unsatisfactory kind of travelling that can possibly
be imagined. &ldquo;Standing pulls&rdquo; must be the
order of the day, and the incessant &ldquo;one, two, three,
haul&rdquo; is constantly heard. The trudging backwards
and forwards to drag the different sledges to the front
along the same road is decidedly monotonous; but
this had no effect on the cheerfulness and general
good spirits of the men, who were all actuated by the
same zealous desire to do their best. The temperature
all day had been delightful, ranging from 8° to
20° below zero.</p>

<p><i>April 13th.</i>&mdash;A dull, cloudy day, with the sun
shining at intervals, and the temperature as low at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
one time as -33°. We cut a road and dragged the
sledges through a fringe of hummocks about two
hundred yards in breadth, then crossed a fine large
floe that afforded us capital travelling for nearly a
mile in a northerly direction, then through another
long fringe of large and troublesome hummocks, until
we were completely brought to a standstill by a mass
of enormous fragments of ice, piled up in an irregular
form to the height of from twenty to thirty feet.
Through this obstacle we resolved to cut a road: in
fact, no other alternative offered. It was a long and
tedious job; but with such a hearty good will did the
men work that we had the satisfaction of dragging our
sledges over a very rough road and encamping for the
night with the difficulties in our rear. Parr with pickaxe
and shovel was a first-rate &ldquo;navvy,&rdquo; and worked
like a horse.</p>

<p>Our routine was for one or other of us to select the
best route through the hummocks. This being done,
one, with a gang of road-makers, proceeded to construct
the road, whilst the other, with the remainder
of the party, dragged the sledges on one by one.
Great care had to be taken that our boats, on the
exceedingly rough road over which they were dragged,
did not sustain any injury. Sometimes it was a very
delicate matter, and one that required skilful handling,
after the sledges had been hauled up to the top
of the hummocks, to lower them down in safety on
the opposite side. The ease and facility with which
the ice yielded to the dexterous blows of the pickaxes,
wielded by strong and determined men, was almost
incredible. Apparently impenetrable masses of ice
vanished before their efforts, and left a fairly good
road by which we advanced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span></p>

<p><i>April 14th.</i>&mdash;Last night our sleeping-bags were
frozen so hard that it was with great difficulty we
succeeded in getting into them. Even when this was
accomplished, the warmth we derived from them was
inappreciable, and we felt more as if we were confined
in a wooden box or coffin than in a woollen bag! My
blanket wrappers, although I laid on them all night,
were so stiff this morning that I had the utmost
difficulty in bending them over my feet! Being Good
Friday, our prayers in the morning were of longer
duration than usual.</p>

<p>Crossed an old floe having a hard incrustation on
its surface&mdash;not sufficiently strong, however, to bear
the weight either of the men or the sledges; consequently
at every step we broke through, and would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
then sink deeply into soft snow. This was not only
very laborious but very aggravating work.</p>

<p>On portions of the road, where these patches of
level soft snow occurred, the flat-bottomed taboggans,
used in the Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s territory, would
be suitable. But the greater part of the road was
over heavy broken-up hummocks and hard fragments
of ice, lying at all kinds of angles; on the whole we
found the eight-men high-runner sledge which we
used, and which was originally designed by Sir
Leopold McClintock, infinitely preferable. Long experience
has conclusively proved its excellence. It
was the kind of sledge with which the North West
Passage was discovered and the Parry Islands explored,
and with us it once more did most admirable
service in many directions, and over the roughest
ground imaginable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span></p>

<p>The temperature was too low to allow us to stop
for the purpose of obtaining a meridian altitude,
which we invariably get at noon. There was an unpleasant
nipping breeze from the northward; our
faces, more especially our noses, being &ldquo;touched up&rdquo;
constantly by Jack Frost.</p>

<p>The floes off Cape Joseph Henry, although actually
smaller than most of those we have crossed, were far
more heavy. In all probability they are reduced in
size by great and continual pressure off the cape.
The wind freshening, and the weather becoming
very thick, we halted an hour earlier than we otherwise
would have done.</p>

<p>John Shirley, one of my sledge crew, complained of
pains in his ankles and knees. On examination they
appeared slightly swollen, and I treated him according
to the instructions laid down for the guidance of the
sledging officers by our doctor.</p>

<p>Although at the time ignorant of the fact, this was
the first appearance of that dreadful disease, scurvy,
which shortly afterwards laid its destroying hand
upon us, and reduced us to such a helpless and prostrate
state. From this day we were deprived of the
services of Shirley, who gradually but surely got
worse, and was never again able to render the
slightest assistance even in the most minute details
of our routine.</p>

<p><i>April 15th.</i>&mdash;A N.W. gale, with an exceedingly low
temperature, and an impervious snow-drift, rendered
travelling quite out of the question.</p>

<p>Extreme wretchedness, I might almost say abject
misery, was our lot to-day.</p>

<p>We appeared to receive little benefit, in the way
of warmth, from our tent robes, and the temperature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>
inside our tent, with our whole party huddled close
together, was 22° below zero! Gladly would we have
pushed on had it been possible. A hard day&rsquo;s work,
even amongst the most impenetrable hummocks,
would have been infinitely preferable to our present
forced detention and inactivity. Unable to stir outside
the tent, on account of the blinding snow-drift
that was whirling around, too cold to read or even to
sit up in one&rsquo;s bag for the sake of conversation, tent
robes and bags frozen hard&mdash;a combination of these
evils renders the position of those who suffer from
them an unenviable one indeed. It is a remarkable
fact that we this day experienced a lower temperature
during a gale of wind than we did during the whole
winter at the &ldquo;Alert&rsquo;s&rdquo; winter quarters. This appears
to point conclusively to the fact that there can
be no large body of water either to the northward or
westward of us.</p>

<p>The thermometer invariably rose during the
southerly gales experienced in the winter, and this
was very naturally attributed to the wind blowing
across a large expanse of open water.</p>

<p><i>April 16th.</i>&mdash;Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>The gale, although it had moderated, was still
blowing too fiercely to allow us to proceed. We were
therefore compelled, sorely against our inclination,
to remain encamped. We unanimously came to the
conclusion that this was by far the most wretched and
miserable Easter Sunday that we had ever spent.
Forty-eight hours in a gale of wind, tied up in a bag
off the most northern known land, with a temperature
67° below freezing point, is certainly not the most
pleasant manner that any one would select for passing
an Easter Sunday!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span></p>

<p>For forty hours I did not have the slightest feeling
in my feet, and could not really declare that I was in
possession of those useful members&mdash;as for sleep,
under the circumstances, that was quite out of the
question. In spite of the cold and dismal surroundings,
we did not neglect last evening the usual
Saturday night&rsquo;s toast, on receipt of our small allowance
of grog. It most decidedly had the effect of
cheering us up considerably, and for the time assisted
in making us forget the discomfort of our position.
At half-past four in the afternoon, the wind having
subsided, it was determined to make a move. We
felt that anything was preferable to the tedium and
dreariness of our compulsory detention. The tents
were accordingly struck, sledges packed, and the
march renewed. Shirley, being unable to walk, was
placed in his sleeping-bag, rolled up in the tent robes,
and tied securely on one of the sledges. This seriously
added to the weight to be dragged, whilst it also reduced
our motive power; however, we hoped that by
thus giving him complete rest, he would the more
rapidly recover and resume his place on the drag-ropes.</p>

<p>Alas! how little did we think that the fearful and
wasting disease, the premonitory symptoms of which
were now exhibited, would insidiously steal its way
amongst us, and assailing the party one by one
reduce us so disastrously as to bring us to the verge
of destruction!</p>

<p>We cut our way through a hedge of hummocks
about one-third of a mile in breadth, and then on
to a floe apparently of great thickness; but, unfortunately
for us, not more than three hundred yards
across. Between these stupendous floes we would occasionally
meet with some young ice amongst the hummocks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
which, when it trended in the right direction,
would afford us easy travelling; but these leads were
never of any extent.</p>

<p>The gale had accumulated the snow in deep drifts,
which rendered the task of dragging the sledges
harder than ever. Our progress was necessarily slow.
We halted and encamped at half-past ten. The men
appeared to be more easily fatigued after lying so
long idle in their bags than if they had performed a
hard day&rsquo;s work. Our camp this evening was pitched
almost abreast of Cape Joseph Henry, though some
miles off it.</p>

<p>When viewed from seaward, or more correctly
speaking, &ldquo;iceward,&rdquo; this headland presents a bold
and rugged appearance, rising nearly perpendicular
from base to summit, to a height of about eight
hundred feet, whence the land recedes, gradually
ascending until it culminates in a peak about three
or four hundred feet higher. It appears to be of
limestone formation, with regular stratifications dipping
to the southward at an angle of 6° to 10° from
the horizontal. The Cape itself terminates in a knife-like
edge from summit to base, in shape very much
resembling the ram-bow of an ironclad. Conical
Hill, situated immediately to the southward of Cape
Joseph Henry, when observed on the same bearing,
presents more the form of a hog&rsquo;s back than a cone,
but possesses the same bold, rugged aspect. It is
about the same height as the peak surmounting Cape
Joseph Henry, and is of the same formation; but,
unlike its neighbour, the strata dip to the southward
at an angle of about 6° or 10° from the vertical, giving
it altogether a rather distorted appearance. There is
a great deal of similarity in the surrounding hills, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
being more or less coniform, and of an altitude of
from one to two thousand feet.</p>

<p><i>April 17th.</i>&mdash;Shirley no better this morning, and
to add to our troubles, George Porter, one of Parr&rsquo;s
sledge crew, was also suffering in the same manner
from swollen and puffy knee joints.</p>

<p>Two men <i>hors de combat</i> out of our little force
diminishes our strength very materially, and as they
have both to be carried on the sledges it adds
seriously to the weights to be dragged. The morning
was bright and sunny, with a temperature as high as
24° below zero, so we congratulated ourselves that it
was now really on the turn, and that we should no
longer encounter any more extreme cold. The men
take kindly to their snow-goggles, and never attempt
to take them off whilst on the march&mdash;perhaps my
expatiating largely on the excruciating agony and
acute pain inseparable from snow blindness, is in
some way connected with their submissiveness in
this respect! Alfred Pearce was, yesterday, rather
severely frost-bitten on one of his fingers; but circulation
was rapidly restored, and to-day, with the
exception of a little soreness, he suffers no ill effects
from it. The travelling to-day was nearly a repetition
of what we had hitherto been encountering: large
masses of ice thickly compacted together, squeezed
up into every conceivable, but indescribable, shape
and form to a height of about twenty-five feet; but
these had to succumb to the strenuous exertions of
Parr and his indefatigable road-makers.</p>

<p>Energy and perseverance performed wonders. The
men worked uncommonly well&mdash;my only fear was that
they would overtax their strength. Poor fellows!
they get little rest during the day, for even when we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
halt for lunch, they are compelled to be continually
on the move to keep their blood in circulation. To
sit or lie down for any length of time would be fatal.
No wonder, then, they are fatigued at the end of the
day&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>Some of the floes over which we travelled to-day
were of greater thickness than others, and it was no
unfrequent occurrence for us to drop a height of six
or seven feet from the top of one floe to the surface of
another; or, <i>vice versâ</i>, to have to haul the sledges up
the same height. This was no easy work with our
heavily laden sledges and boats. Snow commenced
falling at 3 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, and continued all night.</p>

<p><i>April 18th.</i>&mdash;The old story last night with our
sleeping-bags! So hard were they frozen that it
occupied us a considerable time before we could
struggle into them. The night, however, was not
so cold, and we succeeded in sleeping pretty comfortably.
Before starting this morning we lightened our
heavy sledge by making a redistribution of the weights
on all three sledges. By these means we hoped to be
able to get on a little better.</p>

<p>We found the helmet worsted caps that were so
kindly given to us by the Empress very warm and
comfortable for sleeping in. They are much appreciated
by the men, who call them &ldquo;Eugenies,&rdquo; and
they constantly refer with gratitude to her Majesty&rsquo;s
kind and thoughtful present.</p>

<p>The travelling to-day was excessively heavy, in
consequence of the unevenness of the floes and the
deep soft snow with which they were covered. After
lunch we arrived at and crossed some &ldquo;veritable
palæocrystic floes&rdquo;&mdash;apparently of gigantic thickness,
and studded with numerous rounded snow hillocks;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
the height of some of the latter being as much as
thirty feet above the surface of the floe. In crossing
one of these, the &ldquo;Victoria&rdquo; sledge capsized, but was
soon righted without damaging either the sledge or the
boat, or injuring the invalid who was lashed on top,
and who received only a slight shaking. As we proceeded
northwards we opened out the land to the
westward, and a large bay which has since been called
Clements Markham Inlet. A S.E. breeze sprang up
in the evening shortly before we halted, which,
strange to say, sent the temperature down rapidly
to -33°, and we had, in consequence, to be cautious
about frost-bites.</p>

<p><i>April 19th.</i>&mdash;A fine clear day. Our bags last night
were rendered a little more habitable by having been
exposed during the day to the heat of the sun, which
was sufficiently powerful to extract the greater part of
the moisture which had been absorbed by them. Our
plan is on fine days to suspend as much as we possibly
can from the masts and yards of the boats, and
to spread the gear out over the sledges, so that it
may dry as we travel along. This answers admirably
and enables us to pass more comfortable nights.</p>

<p>After toiling hard for three and a half hours,
during which time we had advanced the sledges
barely a quarter of a mile, I came to the determination
to abandon our largest boat. It was
heart-breaking to witness the men slaving in their
endeavours to drag on the heavy sledge and boat&mdash;to
see the continual standing pulls, the incessant
&ldquo;one, two, three, haul,&rdquo; and no result.</p>

<p>I did not arrive at this decision until after very
mature deliberation. My conviction was that amongst
such ice as that over which we were travelling, should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
a disruption occur, our boats would be of little service
to us, except as a means of ferrying from one floe
to another. For this purpose I retain the smaller
boat.</p>

<p>Leaving the boat in as conspicuous a position as
possible, with her mast stepped and yard triced up,
and having obtained a round of angles in order to fix
her position, so as to facilitate our finding her on the
return journey, the march was resumed, every one
well pleased at being rid of the incubus, as the large
boat was always regarded. We travelled over deep
and uneven snow ridges, and experienced great difficulty
in getting from one floe to another, on account
of the perpendicular drop. Before halting we got
on to some young ice amongst the hummocks, along
which we rattled gaily, actually performing a distance
of about half a mile in something like two hours!
This is good work for us. It must be remembered
that we have to advance <i>three</i> sledges, and to do this
we have to walk over the same road five times!</p>

<p>If our invalids would only show some symptoms of
improvement we should have more hope of reaching a
higher latitude; but at present they compensate in
weight and loss of power for the abandonment of the
boat. I regard each man carried as about 200 lbs.
extra weight, and the loss of their services on the
drag-ropes is about equal to another 200 lbs. weight
to be added&mdash;therefore the two invalids reckon as
much as 800 lbs., exactly equivalent to the weight of
the deserted boat! So long as they remain ill, we
gain nothing upon the actual weights dragged before
their sickness commenced. Instead of their getting
better, we have the prospect of an increased sick list,
for this evening Alfred Pearce was compelled to fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
out from the drag-ropes, suffering from a badly
swollen ankle, and exhibiting in fact the same symptoms
as the other men.</p>

<p><i>April 20th.</i>&mdash;This morning we were unable to make
a start in consequence of the thickness of the weather.
Snow was falling slightly, but the fog was so dense
that it was impossible to see the length of the sledge
ahead. As I had brought with me one of Dickens&rsquo;s
works, &ldquo;The Old Curiosity Shop,&rdquo; I read aloud to the
men, who were much interested in the story.</p>

<p>By 2 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, the weather having cleared slightly, we
determined to push on and find our way through the
fog and hummocks as best we could. The snow was
very deep and the hummocks appeared to be interminable.
The task of selecting a road was by no means
easy&mdash;nothing to be seen but hummocks in every
direction. At eight o&rsquo;clock, the fog lifting a little, we
succeeded in extricating ourselves from our difficulties,
and crossing a large heavy floe got on to a lead
of young ice which gave us good travelling. Although
this young ice enabled us to travel quicker, and rendered
the work of dragging easier, still I was sorry to
see it, as I was rather apprehensive that the pack
might break up earlier than we anticipated, and so
place us in an exceedingly awkward predicament.
We halted and camped at half-past ten, having (considering
the lateness of our start) performed a fair
day&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p><i>April 21st.</i>&mdash;A keen piercing wind from the northward.
Travelling much the same. Although the
temperature was only 17° below zero, the cold was
more intense than we had yet felt it since leaving
the ship. The wind seemed to cut us in two, and was
the cause of numerous superficial frost-bites. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
man, Thomas Simpson, was rather severely frost-bitten
in the big toe, which was, however, quickly
attended to and brought round.</p>

<p>Our greatest enemies, whilst crossing a floe of any
extent, were the numberless cracks and fissures in the
ice, radiating in all directions and treacherously concealed
by a covering of snow. Into these we frequently
fell, and as some of them were of great depth
it seemed almost miraculous that we escaped without
a fractured limb! These cracks must be produced
either by enormous pressure or intense cold.</p>

<p><i>April 22nd.</i>&mdash;The wind blew in heavy squalls last
night, and continued fresh this morning; but as we
all dreaded a longer detention in our tent we resolved
to push on at all hazards.</p>

<p>It was painful to witness the efforts of the poor
fellows in their endeavours to protect their faces from
the cold cutting wind as they plodded along, dragging
the heavily laden sledges; but they seemed cheerful
enough, and treated the numerous frost-bites that
appeared on their cheeks as rather a good joke than
anything else. The sun peeped out for a few
moments during the afternoon; but a heavy mist
hung over the land, entirely obscuring it from our
view. The floes over which we travelled to-day
were more level than any we had yet crossed, and
infinitely larger; but as a set-off against this, we
found the snow very deep, which rendered the dragging
excessively laborious. Few hummocks adorned
the edges of these floes. They appeared to have
come into contact with each other in a most amicable
manner, and then immediately united before any
pressure could be exerted, so as to form the immense
hedges of heaped-up masses of ice that have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
hitherto been our great bugbear. One floe crossed
to-day was estimated at about a mile and three-quarters
in length, and about six miles in circumference.</p>

<p><i>April 23rd.</i>&mdash;Progressing but slowly. The travelling
was very heavy, through deep soft snow, and we
were delayed considerably by being obliged to make
roads over broad belts of heavy hummocks.</p>

<p>We camped for the night on the verge of a floe,
with enormous hummocks squeezed up together immediately
in front. The prospect of advancing was
not cheering! A S.E. breeze, springing up in the
afternoon, sent the temperature down suddenly to
-24°. Our invalids did not appear to be improving,
and we were rather puzzled at some of their symptoms.</p>

<p><i>April 24th.</i>&mdash;The greater part of the day was
employed in cutting a road through a perfect sea
of hummocks. They appeared to be interminable.
From the highest we could see nothing like a floe,
nothing but an uneven range of massive and shapeless
blocks of ice. The road-making was very hard
and <i>very</i> cold work, and the men had to be relieved
pretty often with the tools.</p>

<p>Skill is of more avail at this sort of work than
brute force. A skilled workman will soon demolish
a large hummock, on which a strong but inexperienced
man is wasting all his energy and strength in fruitless
blows.</p>

<p>We had the satisfaction to-day of crossing the
eighty-third parallel of latitude,<a name="fa1p" id="fa1p" href="#ft1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and of knowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
that we were the first party of men that had ever
reached such a high position. The wind to-day,
although decidedly unpleasant, was of some service,
for being from the southward we were able to make
sail on our sledges and thus utilize the otherwise
unwelcome breeze.</p>

<p><i>April 25th.</i>&mdash;A beautiful day, but with a low
temperature. A slight breeze from the eastward
reminded us that we possessed noses. These latter
appendages have been voted decided nuisances, and
could easily be dispensed with whilst sledging! The
travelling to-day was a slight improvement on our
preceding day&rsquo;s work. Indeed at one time we were
able to advance our two light sledges &ldquo;single banked,&rdquo;
that is with their own individual crews, instead of
employing both crews to drag on one sledge at a
time; but this was only for a very short distance.
The snow was very deep and of a tenacious consistency,
clinging to the sledge runners and thereby
seriously impeding our progress. So powerful were
the rays of the sun this afternoon that my thermometer,
when exposed to them, rose rapidly from -17°
to -3°. At 6 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> I observed faint parhelia showing
prismatic colours. We were delayed towards the end
of the day by a broad belt of hummocks, through
which a road had to be cut. The large hummocks
passed to-day, although smooth and rounded on the
top and on one side, were precipitous on the other
and were fully thirty feet high. Some of them
appeared like isolated fragments in the centre of a
floe, and resembled the large grounded floe-bergs in
the vicinity of the &ldquo;Alert&rsquo;s&rdquo; winter quarters. They
were undoubtedly portions of the floe which had been
broken off and squeezed up under irresistible pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span></p>

<p><i>April 26th.</i>&mdash;Temperature to-day as high as -2°.
For the first time, since we have been away, were
we able thoroughly to enjoy our lunch. On account
of the increased warmth, our bacon was more palateable,
and we could throw our wearied forms on the
soft snow and discuss our pint of tea without running
the risk of having our toes frost-bitten. The sensation
of possessing feet was a novel and delightful one.
Several of the men have of late been attacked by
violent bleedings of the nose; but this, in all probability,
is due to the rise of temperature. No improvement
in our travelling&mdash;still the same old
story&mdash;hummocks and snow-drifts, snow-drifts and
hummocks. So dense were the latter that, when
we halted for the night, it really seemed as if we had
arrived at &ldquo;the end of all things;&rdquo; for in front of
us was an apparently impassable sea of hummocks
extending north, east, and west as far as the range of
vision. A dismal prospect, indeed! But we did not
despair, and still hoped we might cut our way through
these obstacles, and emerge upon floes along which
we should have little difficulty in advancing.</p>

<p><i>April 27th.</i>&mdash;A hard day&rsquo;s work! Road-makers
incessantly employed, and the sledges &ldquo;double banked&rdquo;
the whole day, progress being necessarily slow. Our
invalids showed no signs of amendment, indeed two
others exhibited symptoms of the same disease; for
such it appears to be.</p>

<p>Another great misfortune that happened was that
both our shovels came to grief&mdash;the handles breaking
off at the junction between the wood and iron. We,
however, succeeded in &ldquo;fishing&rdquo; and thus rendering
them serviceable. We should be in a sorry plight if
any accident happened to our pickaxes as well as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>
our shovels. As an instance of the amount of walking
we had to perform, I may mention that to-day I
had, of necessity, to cross the same floe, on which the
snow was knee-deep, no less than thirteen times,
&ldquo;and didn&rsquo;t I hate that blackguard floe!&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>April 28th.</i>&mdash;The temperature actually rose as high
as +2°! This is the first day that we have registered
the thermometer above zero! It is a decided improvement.</p>

<p>Last night, inside my tent, the temperature was as
high as 33°, and, in spite of a hard day&rsquo;s work, we
were all busily employed, after supper was over, in
some way or another. A couple were splicing lanyards
in their drag-belts; one was tailoring; another
repairing his moccasins; one was darning his mitts,
and another patching up his stockings with an old
blanket wrapper; whilst I was both reading aloud
and dressing and bandaging my patients&rsquo; legs. All
were smoking except myself. The effect in a small
confined tent may be imagined!</p>

<p>Two of the men, who are not tobacco smokers,
smoked what they called &ldquo;herb&rdquo; tobacco, which diffused
a rather pleasing aroma, and served to deaden
the unpleasantness of the tobacco smoke. It is composed
of various dried aromatic herbs, and is, I
believe, recommended by the faculty for many disorders.</p>

<p>The travelling was as bad as ever&mdash;through heavy
hummocks and deep snow-drifts. We had the misfortune
to capsize the sledge, on which was one of the
invalids; but a slight delay was the only inconvenience
caused. The weather in the afternoon
became very thick, making it extremely difficult to
select a route. Everything was of one uniform colour:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
above, below, behind, and before; all was alike, and it
was quite impossible to tell whether we were going up
or down hill until a fall would inform us of the fact.
To our great surprise, this evening, we came across
the traces of a hare in the soft snow. They were
apparently recent, and travelling in a southerly
direction. The little creature was evidently very
tired, as the footsteps appeared to be close together.
Poor Pussy! it must have wandered out on the floe
and lost itself, for we were quite seventeen miles from
the nearest land. I have no doubt, if we had followed
up the track, that we should have found the poor little
animal lying dead or exhausted under some hummock,
famished for want of food.</p>

<p><i>April 29th.</i>&mdash;Small floes surrounded with high
hummocks and covered with deep snow, were still
encountered, with occasionally a short lead on some
young ice that we sometimes met twining round
the larger floes. It was difficult to account for the
presence of so much young ice, and I can only suggest
that, after the disruption in the summer, the
pack remained some length of time in a quiescent
state, and so allowed the young ice to form between
the floes; for if once in motion, no ice of a single
season&rsquo;s formation could withstand the tremendous
pressure that would be exerted by these stupendous
floes, but must inevitably be pulverized and
broken up into small fragments. Our wretched
cook last night made our tea and cooked our pemmican
with the water obtained from salt-water ice.
We all in consequence suffered from intense thirst,
without being able to obtain anything to alleviate it.</p>

<p><i>April 30th.</i>&mdash;After halting last night the wind
freshened into a gale, the clouds thickened, and snow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>
began to fall heavily, and this continued all day without
intermission, so much so that we were unable to
make a start. It was impossible to see the length of
the sledge ahead, and, surrounded as we were by
hummocks, it would have been folly to have attempted
a move. We consoled ourselves by saying that the
rest would do us good, and that the invalids more
especially would benefit by it.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">May</span> <i>1st.</i>&mdash;A fine sunny morning ushered in the
month of May, all the more appreciated in consequence
of the enforced idleness of the preceding day.
The bright sun had a wonderful effect upon us all.
It seemed to cheer and invigorate our spirits, whilst
it stimulated us to renewed exertions in our endeavours
to reach as high a northern latitude as
possible. Our invalids, however, were very faint and
weak. They exhibited no favourable symptoms of
improvement, and were a great clog and drawback to
our progress. With our diminished crews we found
it hard work to drag the sledges over the rough
hummocky road, and through the deep soft snow-drifts
that were constantly met. Road-making became
a necessary part of the daily routine. Floes of any
extent were rarely seen, and we had to thread our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>299</span>
way through a perfect labyrinth of piled-up masses of
ice, with little or no prospect of its improving. It
was a dreary and wild-looking scene: no living thing
in sight but our own little party, no colour or object
to relieve the eye; nothing but a chaotic and illimitable
sea of ice. Sometimes a fog was observed gradually
rolling itself towards us, like a large mantle, until we
were completely enveloped in its dense folds; when,
continuing its onward course, it would roll as rapidly
away, leaving a bright luminous band stretching
across the horizon in the direction whence it had
come.</p>

<p><i>May 2nd.</i>&mdash;Although we had been told that there
was not the slightest chance of our being attacked
with scurvy, still, from the utter prostration of our
invalids, combined with other symptoms, we were
almost inclined to believe that we were really afflicted
with this dire and wasting disease. It was a terrible
idea that forced itself upon us, and one that we were
loath to indulge in; but we feared that the symptoms
pointed unmistakeably to the fact that this fearful
disease, so dreaded by the mariners of old, was
gradually but surely laying its hand upon us, completely
prostrating those it attacked and rendering
them helpless from pain and exhaustion. Parr and
myself spoke of it only when we were by ourselves,
as we considered it of the utmost importance that the
men should remain in ignorance as long as possible,
and not even suspect the nature of the disease which
had crippled so many of their number. Swollen
joints and discolouration of the skin, attended with
faintness and great weakness, were the principal
symptoms. Great as were the natural difficulties
which surrounded us, still, should our surmise be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
correct, we could not but regard this as the most
formidable of all obstacles to our advance that could
possibly be imagined. Our only hope was that the
five men now afflicted might, through their habits or
disposition, have been more prone to the attacks of
this insidious disease, than the remainder of our
party, who, we hoped, might escape scathless. We
camped this evening amidst a pile of hummocks, after
one of the hardest day&rsquo;s work we have yet performed.
So rough was the road and so deep was the snow that
the sledges could only be advanced by &ldquo;standing
pulls.&rdquo; This was disheartening, for we had all been
cherishing the hope that as we advanced northwards
we should find larger and more level floes and less
snow; the reverse, however, was the case. Several
times did one or other of us disappear through deep
rents in the floe, but we always succeeded in scrambling
up again unhurt.</p>

<p><i>May 3rd.</i>&mdash;A dull, dark, foggy day rendered it
extremely difficult to select our road, and we were
occasionally compelled to unload the sledges before
they could be dragged through the deep soft snow-drifts
which were continually met across our route,
making the work all the more hard and distressing.
The fog persistently hung over us all day; but was
not sufficiently dense to retard our progress altogether,
though it materially increased our labours and
augmented our difficulties.</p>

<p><i>May 4th.</i>&mdash;Everything appeared to combine against
us: weather, snow ice, and sickness! In spite of
these evils our tents were struck and a start made;
but after advancing for half a mile, which took us
exactly three and a half hours to accomplish, we
arrived at such a confused heap of hummocks that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>301</span>
with the dense fog prevailing and the falling snow, it
was impossible to make any headway. To persevere
would have been imprudent. The tents were accordingly
pitched, and we consoled ourselves by saying
that the rest would be productive of much good to
our sick companions, for even those that had to be
carried on the sledges could get no rest whilst being
dragged and jolted and sometimes capsized over the
roughest road imaginable. After lunch, the weather
clearing a little, we employed ourselves in cutting a
road through an amorphous conglomeration of ice
for quite three-quarters of a mile. The pack over
which we were travelling appeared to consist of
numerous small floes, the largest being barely one
hundred yards across at its widest diameter, but the
majority much smaller, and each of these floes was
surrounded by a mass of hummocks piled up and
lying one on top of the other to the height of twenty
and thirty feet: the belts of hummocks being from
thirty to forty yards in breadth.</p>

<p>Observing one large hummock to be very much
discoloured, we found, on approach, that this discolouration
was caused by the adhesion of mud or
clay, a line of which extended for some distance
along the edge of the floe, and gave one the idea
that it had rubbed against, or in some manner had
come into contact with, the shore. Mud it undoubtedly
was, and we bottled a quantity of it for
the purpose of subjecting it to microscopic investigation
when we should return on board. This was
conclusive evidence that a periodical, if not an
annual, disruption of the pack occurs, and that these
floes, although now at such a distance from the land,
had at some time or another been in very close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>
proximity. Moreover, this must have occurred at a
recent date, otherwise the summer thaws and the
autumn snow would have obliterated all such traces
as those we had discovered.</p>

<p><i>May 5th.</i>&mdash;The weather was still as thick as pea-soup!
However, we were able to avail ourselves of
the road that we had constructed yesterday, and
moved our camp so far. To do this, although the
road was fairly good and the distance only three-quarters
of a mile, the time occupied was four and
a half hours! The scene that surrounded our encampment
was a dreary one indeed&mdash;a desolate,
cold, and inhospitable scene: everything of the same
uniform colour; no object to relieve the eye; no
signs of life; nothing to break the stillness and
solitude of this waste of snow and ice. Surely
Shelley must have contemplated such a scene when
he wrote the following lines:</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Those wastes of frozen billows that were hurled</p>
<p class="i05">By everlasting snow-storms round the Poles,</p>
<p class="i05">Where matters dared not vegetate nor live,</p>
<p class="i05">But ceaseless frost round the vast solitude</p>
<p class="i05">Bound the broad zone of stillness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a relief, indeed, to turn from such a scene,
and rest the eye upon our little encampment, while
listening to the cheerful voices of our men, as, oblivious
to hardship and suffering, they sat &ldquo;yarning,&rdquo;
in their tents, and relating to each other their adventures
in other parts of the globe. To our great
satisfaction and comfort the temperature was at, or
about, zero all day, and for the first time, since leaving
the ship, we were able to eat our bacon without
in the first place thawing it in our tea!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span></p>

<p><i>May 6th.</i>&mdash;A fine, bright day; but the rest of
yesterday had produced no beneficial results. Our
invalids were gradually getting worse; even those
who were apparently in good health complained of
aching limbs, and exhibited some of the first symptoms
of those who were already ailing. Four of the
men had also been suffering for the last few days
from snow blindness, though not in a severe form.
A suger of lead lotion afforded them great relief, and
acted as a cure. We had been so far extremely
fortunate in our comparative exemption from this
painful and irritating affliction. We must attribute
our immunity from it to the constant use of our
snow-goggles, which were never taken off until the
time of &ldquo;bagging!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In getting under weigh in the morning, and also
when we are encamping, the sick men cause us
no little delay; for they are perfectly helpless, and
require assistance in every little detail connected
with their dressing and undressing, being totally
incapacitated from doing anything themselves.</p>

<p>The travelling was very heavy. We appeared to
have arrived at a perfect barrier of hummocks, with
portions of large floes intermixed, all broken and
squeezed up together and covered with deep snow.
As far as reaching a high latitude was concerned, we
might as well have turned back at once, for our
advance must needs be slow; but it was not impossible
that this sea of hummocks, with which we
were contending, might be the limit of our rough
road, and that if we could succeed in struggling
through them for a few miles, we might emerge upon
large and level floes on which we should be able to
travel with greater ease and celerity. Possibly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span>
rugged nature of the ice might be due to the junction
of two tides, which, from the commotion produced,
would create the obstacles that were impeding our
progress. After halting for the night, a party of men
were employed road-making whilst the tents were
being pitched and supper preparing. All were very
glad to get into their bags and rest after the fatigues
of the day. A slight air from the S.E. sent the
temperature down rapidly to 11° below zero. The
minus quantities still prevailed.</p>

<p><i>May 7th.</i>&mdash;We started this morning carrying three
of our invalids; but before we had gone many yards
it became painfully evident that the two others were
quite unable to walk, although the gallant fellows
struggled along manfully.</p>

<p>Our only resource was to advance the sledges and
then return with them empty to bring on the other
disabled sufferers. We had now a third of our little
band <i>hors de combat</i>, our strength was diminishing
daily, and our weights on the sledges in consequence
were increasing. The travelling appeared to be getting,
if possible, worse; the hummocks were higher
and the snow-drifts deeper. One of the former, on
being measured by means of a lead line, was found
to be, from the top of the floe to its summit, forty-three
feet three inches.</p>

<p>We halted earlier than usual, and, having constructed
a pedestal for the magnetic instrument out
of solid snow, obtained a series of observations for
the inclination of the needle and for the total
magnetic force.</p>

<p><i>May 8th.</i>&mdash;We at length forced ourselves to believe
that the disease from which our men were
suffering was really scurvy. We issued to those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
were afflicted daily allowances of lime-juice from the
small stock that we brought away with us.</p>

<p>But it was with the utmost difficulty that a small
allowance for each could be thawed. The lime-juice
was in two bottles. On putting one near the cooking
apparatus to thaw, the bottle cracked and fell to
pieces. At last I adopted the plan of placing the
other bottle between my legs when in the sleeping-bag,
and, after a long time, I succeeded in thawing
a small quantity. But it is now known that this was
of no use; for the state of the lime-juice used by
Dr. Coppinger at Polaris Bay showed that the whole
volume must be thawed and remixed before it can be
used with any advantage. This can only be done in
the warmer weather of June or July.</p>

<p>The loss of appetite, depression of spirits, with
other symptoms were, we thought, decidedly scorbutic,
and we feared, without fresh meat and vegetables,
that there was little chance of seeing the sick
men on the drag-ropes again during the journey.
Being a fine, bright day, the invalids were made to
come out and bask in the sun, whilst the rest of the
party, with pickaxes and shovels, were engaged in
cutting a road through the hummocks. A double
series of magnetic observations were obtained, together
with sights for latitude, longitude, and variation
of the compass. The hummocks amongst
which our tents were pitched were of various heights
and bulk, from small fragments of ice to huge piles
over forty feet high. Some of them consisted of a
number of small hummocks squeezed up into one
large mass, whilst others were apparently the regular
floe-bergs, and, although perhaps of greater bulk,
were not quite so high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span></p>

<p>Between these hummocks, and consequently along
the only road where we could drag our sledges, the
snow had accumulated in drifts to a great depth,
and this, formed into ridges by the wind, rendered
the travelling all the more difficult. Occasionally
the tops of these ridges were frozen hard, and it was
of no uncommon occurrence to step from deep snow,
through which we were floundering up to our waists,
on to a hard, frozen piece, or <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes these ridges were only partially frozen,
or covered with a slight crust, just hard enough <i>not</i>
to bear our weights, and this made it exceedingly
disagreeable and laborious to travel over.</p>

<p><i>May 9th.</i>&mdash;Another beautifully warm day, with the
temperature only a degree or two below zero! It was
impossible to remain idle on such a day, so we resolved
to push on.</p>

<p>Lightening two of the sledges of about half their
loads, two of the sick men were placed on them, and
these were dragged to the limit of the road made
yesterday. Here the tent was pitched, the two
invalids placed inside, the sledge unpacked and
dragged back. In this manner we succeeded in
advancing during the day a distance of about three-quarters
of a mile; but so tortuous was our road,
and so often had it to be traversed, that to accomplish
this short distance we had to walk about seven
miles, and this through very deep snow. Rawlings,
Simpson, and Ferbrache were complaining of aching
limbs, and their legs exhibited slight discolouration.</p>

<p><i>May 10th.</i>&mdash;We advanced the sledges in the same
manner as yesterday, accomplishing about the same
distance; but so distressing was it to see the exertions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span>
of the men in their endeavours to perform a good
day&rsquo;s work, and so painful was it to witness the sufferings
of the sick, that I very reluctantly came to the
conclusion that our camp this evening must be our
most northern one. With five of my little force disabled,
and as many more showing decided scorbutic
symptoms, it would have been imprudent to persevere
farther, however much inclination might prompt such
a proceeding. Besides, our provisions must be taken
into consideration, and we had only thirty days left
to take us back a distance that occupied us forty days
to advance, so that our turning back became an
imperative necessity. We might, I think, console
ourselves with the knowledge that the motto engraved
on my flagstaff, and which had been presented to me
by my friend and former Captain, now Commodore
A. H. Hoskins, had been fully carried out. It was
happily chosen, and although the lines are expressed
in the first personal pronoun they had reference to the
whole party:</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;I dare do all that may become a man:</p>
<p class="i05">Who dares do more is none.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>We felt that the absence of any greater success
could not be attributed either to a lack of energy or
of perseverence. It was, however, a bitter ending to
all our aspirations, for which even the knowledge of
being homeward bound failed to compensate. In justice
to my brave companions I must say that no men
could have done more under the same circumstances.</p>

<p><i>May 11th.</i>&mdash;Having arrived at the determination
of dragging the sledges no farther in a northerly
direction, I deemed it desirable to try what good two
days&rsquo; perfect rest would do for our invalids; and, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
there were many useful observations to be taken in
this high latitude, I determined to devote the two
following days to obtaining them. As soon as breakfast
was discussed, a snow pedestal was erected for
the instrument for determining the magnetic force
and inclination of the needle, a double series of
observations being obtained. Sights were taken in
order to fix our position both by latitude and longitude,
and also for the variation of the compass.<a name="fa1q" id="fa1q" href="#ft1q"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>Some of the men were employed in cutting a hole
through young ice that existed between the hummocks
in order that we might obtain deep sea temperatures
with a Casella&rsquo;s thermometer, which we
had brought with us for the purpose.</p>

<p>In three hours this work was accomplished, the
ice being only sixty-four inches in thickness. On
attempting to get soundings, to our great surprise we
succeeded in finding bottom in seventy-one fathoms
(four hundred and twenty-six feet).</p>

<p>At this depth we managed to obtain, by various contrivances
that were lowered down, a specimen of the
bottom, which was carefully bottled, in order to be
carried to the ship, there to undergo microscopic
examination.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">HIGHEST NORTHERN CAMP.</td></tr></table>

<p>Wishing to possess any specimens of animal life
that might exist in this high latitude, a bread bag,
filled with the scrapings of our pannikins and a little
pemmican, was lowered to the bottom, and, having
been kept there some hours, was hauled up, and to
our great joy found to be almost alive with numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
small crustaceans<a name="fa2q" id="fa2q" href="#ft2q"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and foraminifera; specimens of
which were, of course, collected and preserved, being
the most northern animal life yet discovered. With
our thermometer a series of temperatures was taken
at every ten fathoms, whilst the specific gravity of
the surface water was also obtained.</p>

<p>Tidal action was apparent; but, with the means at
our disposal, we were unable to observe the rise and
fall of the tide, or to make any accurate measurement
regarding it. Altogether the day was not unprofitably
spent.</p>

<p><i>May 12th.</i>&mdash;This 12th of May must always be regarded
as an eventful day in the lives of our little party,
for it was that on which we had the honour, and no
small gratification, of planting the Union Jack on the
most northern limit of the globe ever attained by
civilized man, or, in fact, so far as our knowledge
goes, by mortal man! In order to insure being
within four hundred miles of the North Pole, we
started immediately after breakfast to the northward,
carrying with us the sextant, artificial horizon, and
all our colours and banners. We were a party of ten,<a name="fa3q" id="fa3q" href="#ft3q"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
two men being left behind to attend to the wants of
the five who were sick, and who were left comfortably
settled inside the tents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span></p>

<p>The walking was undoubtedly severe, at one moment
struggling through deep snow-drifts, in which we
floundered up to our waists, and at another tumbling
about amongst the hummocks.</p>

<p>Some idea may be formed of the difficulties of the
road, when, after more than two hours&rsquo; hard walking,
with little or nothing to carry, we had barely accomplished
one mile!</p>

<p>Shortly before noon a halt was called, the artificial
horizon set up, and the flags and sledge standards
displayed. Fortunately the sun was favourable to us,
and we were able to obtain a good altitude as it passed
the meridian, although almost immediately afterwards
dark clouds rolled up, snow began to fall, and the sun
was lost in obscurity.</p>

<p>We found the latitude to be 83° 20&prime; 26&Prime; N., or three
hundred and ninety-nine miles and a half from the
North Pole. The announcement of our position was
received with three cheers, with one more for Captain
Nares; then all sang the &ldquo;Union Jack of Old
England,&rdquo; our &ldquo;Grand Palæocrystic Sledging Chorus,&rdquo;
winding up, like loyal subjects, with &ldquo;God save the
Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No words of mine could describe the scene that
surrounded us better than those of Coleridge in his
&ldquo;Ancient Mariner&rdquo;:</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;The ice was here, the ice was there,</p>
<p class="i05">The ice was all around.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">For nought else but snow and ice could be seen in
any direction.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of these dreary surroundings,
suggesting everything that was desolate and miserable,
mirth, happiness, and joy seemed to reign paramount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
amongst our little party. Perhaps there was something
in the idea of having been farther north than
any other man had hitherto penetrated, that promoted
such feelings! Whatever produced them, they
were shared in by all. Even the sick, on our return
to camp, prostrate and suffering as they were, participated
in the general hilarity and rejoicing. They
knew their toilsome journey had terminated, and that
each day would bring them nearer to their ship and
to those supplies that were necessary to save their
lives.</p>

<p>On returning to the tents, a magnum of whiskey,
kindly sent by the &ldquo;Dean of Dundee,&rdquo; for the express
purpose of being drunk at our highest northern
position, was broached, and for supper we had divided
amongst the two sledge crews a hare that had been
shot by Dr. Moss on the third day after leaving the
ship. Could men in our position want more? Never
were the bones of a hare picked so clean! No dog
would have benefited much from the scraps remaining
from our repast!</p>

<p>Absent friends were duly toasted, and the evening
was brought to a close with songs, in which even the
invalids joined. All appeared happy, cheerful, and
contented.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">At</span> three o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon of the 13th of May
the homeward march was commenced, our main object,
of course, being to get back to the ship as speedily as
possible.</p>

<p>Before starting, a couple of records, inclosed in two
tin cases, were deposited on the floe. One was placed
as near the centre of the floe as possible, the other
was secured on the top of a hummock.</p>

<p>On the records was stated the latitude and longitude
of the position, together with a few words regarding
the condition of the party. If these are ever picked
up it will be very interesting and important, as
throwing light on the drift or tide in these high
latitudes.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to describe the incidents that
occurred on each successive day during the return
journey. Day by day did our strength diminish.
Gradually, but surely, the men, one after the other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
began to feel the cruel grasp of the disease, as they
struggled manfully on, dragging their poor, helpless
companions, in spite of racking pains and aching
limbs. Although themselves attacked by the dreadful
malady, the men who were still able to work suppressed
their own sufferings in their endeavours to
ameliorate those of their more helpless and ailing
comrades. Unmindful of their own miserable plight,
they devoted themselves to the tender and soothing
functions of nurses with a thoughtful and careful
tenderness that would have done credit even to those
of the weaker sex.</p>

<p>Often had the same road to be traversed, as the
sledges were advanced one at a time, and most
fortunate was it that we were able to adhere to the
road constructed during our outward journey. To do
so, however, during the thick weather which constantly
prevailed, was a task of great difficulty and very
trying to the eyes; but we knew that if by ill-luck we
should wander away and lose it, our chances of ever
seeing the ship again would be poor indeed! The
hours selected for travelling were between 6 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> and
6 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> By choosing this part of the day, or rather
night, for working, we kept the sun as much as
possible at our backs, and slept during the warmth
of the day. Towards the end of May, although the
temperature of the outside air was below the freezing
point, the sun was so powerful that it would raise
the temperature inside our tent, whilst we were
sleeping, to as much as 70° or 80°, which would be
quite unbearable! Frost-bites had become a thing
of the past, and were no longer dreaded. The temperature
did not rise above the freezing point until
the month of June.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span></p>

<p>Snow fell heavily during the greater part of the
return journey, and fogs were very prevalent. Gales
of wind had to be endured, for to halt was out of the
question&mdash;rest there was none&mdash;onward was the order
of the day.</p>

<p>As the disease gradually assumed the mastery over
the party, so did the appetites decrease, and in a very
alarming manner, until it was with the greatest
difficulty that anybody could be induced to eat at all.
Instead of each man disposing of one pound of
pemmican a day, the same quantity sufficed for the
entire party in one tent; and even this, occasionally,
was not consumed. Nor was the subject of eating
and drinking so often discussed. During the outward
journey, beefsteaks and onions, mutton chops and
new potatoes, and Bass&rsquo;s beer formed the chief topics
of conversation. On the return journey they were
scarcely alluded to. Hunger was never felt; but we
were all assailed by an intolerable thirst, which could
only be appeased at meal times, or after the temperature
was sufficiently high to admit of quenching our
thirst by putting icicles into our mouths.</p>

<p>Aching bones and sleepless nights were the chief
causes of our sufferings.</p>

<p>With all these hardships it was a great comfort to
be able to put on dry foot gear. If it was fine when
we encamped, our blanket wrappers and hose were
spread out on the tent in the sun, so that when we
got up they were not only dry, but <i>not frozen</i>, and
were, therefore, limp and supple!</p>

<p>On the 17th of May we again, strange to say,
crossed the track of a hare, being at the time about
twenty-five miles from the nearest land. Like the
track before seen, the footsteps were close together,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span>
indicating that the poor little creature was in a very
exhausted state. Although the traces were very
indistinct, they appeared to be going in a northerly
direction.</p>

<p>Though our travelling was slow, we could see a
perceptible decrease in the distance between ourselves
and the land, whenever the weather was fine enough
for us to observe it. &ldquo;Old Joe,&rdquo; as the men irreverently
termed Cape Joseph Henry, loomed nearer
and darker, and we all regarded it with anxious,
longing eyes.</p>

<p>On the 18th of May the first icicles were observed
hanging from the edges of a few hummocks&mdash;a sure
sign of the returning power of the sun.</p>

<p>Ominous symptoms of a disruption of the pack
were seen on the same day, and again on the following
one. A crack in some ice had opened considerably
since we last passed over it, whilst small hummocks
had been formed by the pressure of two floes, one
against the other. These little indications made
matters assume a still more serious aspect. They
may have been due to tidal action, but they were
undoubtedly warnings to get off the pack as speedily
as possible.</p>

<p>On the 20th the snow crystals that fell actually
melted on coming into contact with our clothes or
any dark substance. These crystals were all of a
beautiful stellar shape. A hummock passed, although
composed, apparently, of one piece of ice, was of
two different colours, a deep blue and a pale yellow.
Portions of each were broken off for the purpose of
testing their respective specific gravities, and also to
carry back to the ship for analysis. In all probability
the discolouration was caused by the presence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
diatomaceæ. The hummocks, at about this date,
began to assume a different appearance, the mild
weather depriving them of their snowy covering, and
causing them to lose much of their former resemblance
to gigantic wedding cakes!</p>

<p>The men began to have an inkling of the nature
of the disease from which they were suffering,
although we studiously avoided all mention of it.
It went with them by the name of the &ldquo;Joseph
Henry mange!&rdquo; Their spirits were wonderful, and
they joked each other as they hobbled along. Their
lameness they called the &ldquo;Marco Polo limp,&rdquo; and
declared on their return to England they would introduce
it as the fashionable gait!</p>

<p>Nothing appeared to subdue their courage or their
zeal. Orders were always executed with the utmost
willingness and good humour, and with as much
alacrity as they were capable of evincing.</p>

<p>The men having heard that tea-leaves had been
recommended as a good <i>vegetable</i>, the contents of the
tea-kettle, after lunch and supper, were carefully
collected, and devoured with avidity; but there is
little faith, I fear, to be placed in their efficacy for
warding off or subduing our terrible complaint.</p>

<p>Instead of our sledge loads appearing to diminish
in weight as the provisions were consumed, they
seemed to drag heavier, and we were at a loss
whether to attribute this to the depth and softness
of the snow over which we travelled, or to the
increasing weakness of our party! It was hard
work, and as much as we could do to make any
progress at all. The men experienced great difficulty
in moving their legs, the slightest exertion caused
intense pain, and it was a piteous sight to witness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span>
them struggling bravely on, without uttering a murmur
or complaint. They all knew that their only
hope of safety was to get back to the ship as speedily
as possible.</p>

<p>The 24th of May being the Queen&rsquo;s birthday, all
the flags and banners were displayed during the
short time we halted for lunch, and her Majesty&rsquo;s
health was drunk by her most northern and not
least loyal subjects. On that day, amongst the
entire party, we could only muster four and a half
good and sound pairs of legs! Still even those with
&ldquo;game legs&rdquo; stuck to the drag-ropes nobly, and if
they were unable to render much assistance, still the
drag-ropes acted as a support, and therefore enabled
them to keep up.</p>

<p>On the 25th the eighty-third parallel of latitude
was recrossed.</p>

<p>The comparatively high temperature caused the
snow over which we journeyed to assume a &ldquo;sludgy&rdquo;
consistency, which clung tenaciously to our legs and
to the sledge runners, rendering the work of dragging
and walking all the more laborious.</p>

<p>On the 27th the condition of the party was so
critical that it became only too painfully evident that,
to insure their reaching the land alive, the sledges
must be considerably lightened in order to admit
of a more rapid advance. The state of the party
was on that day as follows: five men were in a very
precarious condition, utterly unable to move, and
consequently had to be carried on the sledges; five
others nearly as bad, but who nobly persisted in
hobbling after the sledges, which they could just
manage to accomplish, for, as the sledges had to be
advanced one by one, it gave them plenty of time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
to perform the distance; whilst three others exhibited
all the premonitory scorbutic symptoms. Thus only
the two officers and two men<a name="fa1r" id="fa1r" href="#ft1r"><span class="sp">1</span></a> could be considered as
effective! This was, it must be acknowledged, a very
deplorable state of affairs.</p>

<p>I therefore decided to abandon the remaining boat,
which would materially lessen the load to be dragged.
This decision was only arrived at after long and
anxious consideration. I had to decide which was
the lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>For I well knew that should a disruption of the
pack occur, and we had already observed ominous
signs of such an event, without a boat the party
would indeed be placed in a hopeless position; but
again I knew that in retaining the boat, the weights
to be dragged by our weakened crew would be so
excessive as to preclude the possibility of reaching
the shore before all the provisions would be expended,
and starvation would be the result. Again it was of
the utmost importance that haste should be made
in order to reach the ship, and place the sick under
proper medical treatment. The disease was extending
so rapidly as to produce a marked change for the
worse every day. The boat, therefore, and all superfluous
weights were abandoned, and the march was
again wearily resumed.</p>

<p>Many a silent prayer was offered up to God to
protect and watch over us, for we felt, indeed, that
we were in dire distress, and that without His aid
and assistance we must perish; and we prayed for
strength to enable us to drag our poor helpless and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>319</span>
suffering companions to a place of safety. A record
was left in the deserted boat, containing a brief
account of our state and condition, with the latitude
and longitude where it was abandoned.</p>

<p>On the following day great excitement was caused
by the appearance of a snow bunting, which was seen
fluttering about amongst the hummocks, uttering its
sweet and pleasant chirp, which to us was the most
pleasing music we had heard for many a long day.
No wonder the sudden appearance amongst us of this
little warbler was so interesting, for it was the first
bird we had seen for nine long months. Even the
invalids, as they lay on the sledges, requested that
they might have their faces uncovered, so as both to
see and hear the little friend that had flown off to us,
as if it were a messenger to welcome our party back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
to life and friends. Long and anxiously was it
watched as it winged its course towards the land,
whither we also were slowly wending our way.</p>

<p>On the 29th the colours were again displayed at
lunch time, in commemoration of the first anniversary
of our sailing from England, and allusions were made
to that ever-memorable day, comparisons being drawn
between our condition then and now! On that evening
our tents were pitched close to the boat that we
had abandoned on our outward journey, and which
we found exactly in the same state as when we left
it, with its mast stepped and yard hoisted, standing
out like a grim sentinel guarding those icy wastes.</p>

<p>On the 31st, whilst crossing some young ice between
two heavy floes, one of the sledges broke through, and
we had no little trouble in saving it from complete
immersion, and the invalid who was on it from being
drowned! These warnings were unmistakeable, and
pointed to the necessity of reaching the land as
quickly as possible. The falling snow and drift thawed
upon our clothes, making us wet and extremely
wretched and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June the temperature was some two
or three degrees above freezing point. This had the
effect of thawing the surface snow and converting it
into a thick sludge. Our foot gear in consequence
was in a soaking wet state. Our working force on
this day was reduced to six, and all suffering more
or less.</p>

<p>On the 2nd the thick weather, which had so persistently
clung to us, proved triumphant and robbed
us of our road. Up to this date we had been able to
avail ourselves of the road constructed with so much
trouble and labour on our outward journey. On this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span>
day we wandered off it, and in spite of our efforts
were unable to pick up the trail again. The severe
and monotonous labour of road-making had again to
be resorted to. On the 5th, to our very great joy, we
succeeded once more in pitching our camp on <i>terra
firma</i>, after an absence from it of two months. On
first landing our hopes were excited on observing the
recent traces of a sledge and human footprints, and
we congratulated ourselves upon soon obtaining that
relief we all so much required; but we were doomed
to disappointment, for on reaching the depôt of provisions
established near Cape Joseph Henry for our
use, and which was found intact, we learnt that a
sledge party with Captain Nares had left for the ship
only two days previously! This was a bitter blow, for
we knew that something more than provisions was
needed for the safety of the party.</p>

<p>We learnt also that scurvy had made its appearance
on board the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; and that poor Petersen died
from the effects of his last sledge journey, on the 14th
of May.</p>

<p>Three hares had been kindly and thoughtfully left
for us in a crevice amongst the hummocks by Captain
Nares, and this furnished us with meals for a couple
of days; it is needless to add, they were done ample
justice to, not only for the sake of their goodness and
the change they afforded, but also because we thought
the fresh meat would act as a specific against the
scurvy.</p>

<p>The tracks of a wolf were observed near the depôt,
and the animal was frequently heard howling in a
mournful manner, but we never saw it.</p>

<p>Obtaining a few supplies from the depôt, our march
was again resumed; but so rapid had been the encroachments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
of the disease, that it was only too
palpable that immediate succour was absolutely
necessary for our salvation. At the rate of progress
we were making, it would take us fully three weeks to
reach the ship, although only forty miles distant;
and who would there be left in three weeks&rsquo; time?
The few who were still strong enough to drag the
sledges would barely last as many days! Assistance
had, therefore, to be obtained. To procure it, one
amongst us was ready and willing to set out on this
lonely and solitary mission, with the firm reliance of
being able to accomplish what he had undertaken,
and with the knowledge that he possessed the full confidence
of those for whose relief he was about to start
on a long and hazardous walk. On the 7th of June
Lieut. Parr started on his arduous march to the ship.
Deep and heartfelt were the God-speeds uttered as he
took his departure, and anxiously was his retreating
form watched until it was gradually lost to sight
amidst the interminable hummocks.</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;All waste! no sign of life</p>
<p class="i05">But the track of the wolf and the bear!</p>
<p class="i05">No sound but the wild, wild wind,</p>
<p class="i05">And the snow crunching under his feet.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>Although the loss of one strong man, like Parr,
from the party was seriously felt, still the knowledge
that active steps had been taken to procure aid was
sufficient to compensate for this reduction in our
strength, and the men gallantly persevered at the
drag-ropes, buoyed up by renewed hopes.</p>

<p>On the day previous to that on which Parr left, an
Eskimo dog, to our great surprise, was seen threading
its way to us through the hummocks. It was soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
recognized to be one of our dogs, named Flo; but she
was so timid that at first nothing would induce her
to approach. After a little time, however, we coaxed
her to us, and on having some pemmican thrown to
her she ate it ravenously. Poor thing! she was
wretchedly thin and emaciated; she, we concluded,
had been cast adrift, or made her escape from the last
dog-sledge that visited this neighbourhood. She
joined our tail of cripples, hobbling, like them, after
us and carefully walking in the track of our sledges.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June sadness and despondency prevailed
amongst our little band. One of our number
had received that summons to which all must at some
time attend, and had been called to his long account.</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;His soul to Him who gave it rose.</p>
<p class="i05">God led it to its long repose&mdash;</p>
<p class="i05">Its glorious rest.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>This was a terrible and unexpected blow to many
who regarded themselves as being in a still more
critical and precarious condition than was poor
Porter. His end was calm and peaceful, and he retained
his senses to within five minutes of the time
of dissolution.</p>

<p>Sad and mournful, indeed, was the small procession
that wended its way slowly to the new-made grave,
dug out of a frozen soil, carrying the lifeless remains
of their comrade, covered with the Union Jack, on
the same sledge on which he had been dragged,
whilst alive, for many weeks; and there, with the
tears trickling down their weather-beaten and smoke-begrimed
faces, with their hearts so full as to choke
all utterance, they laid their late fellow-sufferer in his
last resting-place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span></p>

<p>A rude cross, improvised out of the rough materials
that our own equipment supplied, with a brief inscription,
marks the lone and dreary spot in that far-off
icy desert where rests our comrade in his long
sleep that knows no waking, and where probably
human foot will never again tread.</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p class="i05">Our happiest hour is when at last</p>
  <p class="i2">The soul is freed.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>Gladly, after the ceremony was concluded, was the
order to renew the march received, every one being
desirous of quitting a place so fraught with sad and
melancholy associations; the day, as if in unison
with the state of our own thoughts and feelings, was
dull and gloomy.</p>

<p>The late mournful event produced a despondency
in our little band to which we had hitherto been
strangers.</p>

<p>One and all felt and knew that assistance, to be of
any avail, must arrive speedily, and many a wistful
glance was directed towards the south, in the faint
hope of seeing that succour without which they would
surely perish. They felt more their own weakness
and helplessness, and dreaded a recurrence of what
had recently taken place. The journey was silently
and wearily resumed.</p>

<p>As many of the men were unable to eat their
pemmican, on account of the soreness of their gums,
and from a certain dislike that they had lately taken
to it, a new &ldquo;dish&rdquo; was tried, consisting of preserved
potatoes mixed with bacon fat, and although in flavour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span>
if any was perceptible, it rather resembled what starch
might be like, it was decidedly acceptable as a change,
and each person consumed about two-thirds of a
pannikin.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 9th a rainbow was seen,
which, being an unusual sight, afforded much interest.
On the same day, shortly after the march had been
commenced, a moving object was suddenly seen
amidst the hummocks to the southward. At first it
was regarded as an optical illusion, for we could
scarcely realize the fact that it could be anybody from
the &ldquo;Alert!&rdquo; With what intense anxiety this object
was regarded is beyond description.</p>

<p>Gradually emerging from the hummocks, a hearty
cheer put an end to the suspense that was almost
agonizing, as a dog-sledge with three men was seen
to be approaching. A cheer in return was attempted,
but so full were our hearts that it resembled more a
wail than a cheer.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe our feelings as May and
Moss came up, and we received from them a warm
and hearty welcome. We felt that we were saved,
and a feeling of thankfulness and gratitude was uppermost
in our minds, as we shook the hands of those
who had hurried out to our relief the moment that
Parr had conveyed to them intelligence of our distress.
Those who a few short moments before were in the
lowest depths of despondency, appeared now in the
most exuberant spirits. Pain was disregarded and
hardships were forgotten as numerous and varied
questions were asked and answered.</p>

<p>We heard with delight that they were only the vanguard
of a larger party, headed by Captain Nares
himself, that was coming out to our relief, and which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>
we should probably meet on the following day. A
halt was immediately ordered, cooking utensils lighted
up, ice made into water, and we were soon all enjoying
a good pannikin full of lime-juice, with the prospect
of mutton for supper!</p>

<p>After halting for the night Moss made a thorough
medical inspection of the whole party. His report
was by no means cheering: all were more or less
affected, and some were in a very precarious condition.
The presence, however, of a medical officer amongst
us restored confidence, and acted as a powerful antiscorbutic!</p>

<p>On the following day we met the larger party
coming out to our assistance, and with their help
arrived alongside the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; on the 14th of June,
seventy-two days after our departure from the ship.</p>

<p>What a contrast did that departure afford to our
return!</p>

<p>Then, on that bright but cold April morning, all
were in the highest spirits, cheerful and enthusiastic,
looking forward with confidence to a comparatively
successful issue to their undertaking&mdash;a fine, strong,
and resolute band.</p>

<p>Alas! how different was the return! Out of that
party of fifteen men, one had gone to his long home,
eleven others were carried alongside the ship on
sledges dragged by a party despatched to their relief,
and only the remaining three were capable of walking.<a name="fa2r" id="fa2r" href="#ft2r"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
Even they were scarcely able to move one leg
before the other, and were, on their return, placed with
the others under the doctor&rsquo;s hands. It was, indeed,
a sad and terrible calamity with which we had been
afflicted, totally unexpected and unparalleled in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
annals of Arctic sledging experiences. On our arrival
alongside the ship, we were, of course, most warmly
welcomed by every soul on board; before entering
Captain Nares called for three cheers for our party,
and then offered up thanks to Almighty God for
having preserved us through many dangers and privations,
and for guiding us back to our ship without
further loss of life.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> hearty welcome we received from one and all on
board the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; together with the indescribable
pleasure of a warm bath, followed by a champagne
supper for those whom the doctor reported well enough
to indulge in such a luxury, made us all supremely
happy; the feeling being increased by the knowledge
that our suffering companions were under the tender
care of kind and skilful hands, and that all responsibility
connected with their treatment had, so far as
we were concerned, ceased. Our late hardships and
the anxiety we had felt regarding the safe return of
the party were almost forgotten, and were it not for
the number of cots hanging up outside the ward-room,
and the row of beds along the lower deck, each
occupied by a sick man, we should almost have felt
inclined to regard our late sledging expedition as a
dream from which we had suddenly been awakened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>329</span></p>

<p>A more thorough break-up of a healthy and strong
body of men it would be difficult to conceive. Not
only had the men engaged in the extended party
under my command been attacked with scurvy, but
also those who had been absent from the ship only for
short periods, and some, who may be said never to
have left the ship at all, or if they did, only for two
or three days! The disease then could not be attributed
to any special circumstance connected with
sledge travelling.</p>

<p>The seeds must have been sown during the time,
nearly five months, that the sun was absent, and we
were in darkness. Fresh animal and vegetable food
is undoubtedly necessary for the preservation of
health, and its absence is the originating cause of
scurvy. To this originating cause all Arctic Expeditions
have been equally exposed. The predisposing
causes of scurvy, which actually lead to an outbreak
when the originating cause exists, are the long absence
of the sun, entailing darkness, damp, intense cold,
and bad ventilation. To these predisposing causes
our expedition was exposed for a very much longer
period than any other which sent out extended travelling
parties. For this reason other expeditions were
exempt from scurvy while we were attacked. In short,
the different result was caused by the difference in
latitude. As our winter arrangements, and our scale
of diet, both on board and while travelling, were
identical with those of former expeditions, the cause
of the outbreak could not have had anything to do
either with diet or winter routine. Lime-juice, though
most useful in warding off for a time and delaying an
attack of scurvy, and as a cure, will not, with other
circumstances unfavourable, prevent an outbreak.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>330</span>
This is the opinion of all the best medical authorities;
and our experience proved it to be an undoubted fact.
Some of our men had scurvy who never left the ship
and never ceased to take their daily rations of lime-juice,
and others were attacked who went away travelling
at a time when daily rations of lime-juice formed
a part of the sledge dietary.<a name="fa1s" id="fa1s" href="#ft1s"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>In future, when an expedition winters in so high a
latitude as 82° N., the prevention of an outbreak of
scurvy must be secured by improved measures for
mitigating the predisposing causes.</p>

<p>Owing to the condition of the crew of the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo;
Captain Nares publicly announced, on the 16th of
June, that on the return of the sledge parties, he
would endeavour to rejoin the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; and
would then send that vessel to England with all the invalids,
and those unfit to remain out a second winter.
The &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; would pass her second winter at Port
Foulke, whence, in the ensuing spring, parties would
be despatched for the purpose of exploring Hayes
Sound, and the adjacent land. This work completed,
that vessel also would return to England. The
reason that Port Foulke was selected as our future
winter quarters was the amount of animal life, principally
reindeer, reported to abound in that neighbourhood,
and we also anticipated little or no difficulty in
breaking out in the following summer.</p>

<p>This resolution was undoubtedly a wise one, for it
was certain that in the then state of the ship&rsquo;s company
of the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; many lives would be sacrificed
if all the men were required to spend another winter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
in the Arctic Regions. The idea of soon reaching
England acted as a cure upon those who were in the
worst stage of scurvy, and conduced more to their recovery
than all the medicines and careful nursing
that they received from our painstaking and attentive
doctor.</p>

<p>In the mean time great anxiety began to be felt
regarding the safety of the western sledge party under
Aldrich. From the wholesale manner in which the
northern division had been afflicted, it was feared
that they also would not pass scathless.</p>

<p>Still we hoped they would not suffer to the same
extent. Their route was along the coast line, and it
was expected that they would have been able to
supply themselves occasionally with fresh provisions,
such as hares, geese, and perhaps musk-oxen.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, four days after the return of
my party, May, with three men and the dog-sledge,
dragged by our remaining six dogs, left the ship in
order to obtain intelligence of Aldrich&rsquo;s party, and if
necessary to take him relief and assistance. The
succeeding days were anxious ones to all on board,
and many were the trips taken to the summit of
Look-out-hill, in the hope of seeing the returning
sledgers. We could not disguise from ourselves the
fact that unless they returned quickly they would be
placed in a very critical position. In a few days they
must be without provisions. This we knew. The
temperature, too, had reached freezing point, and
frequently stood two or three degrees above it,
causing the surface snow to thaw, and therefore
making the task of dragging a sledge one of severe
and unpleasant toil.</p>

<p>On the 21st the sun reached its highest northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>
declination, and every day would bring us nearer
to another winter; therefore we knew that to effect
our deliverance from the ice this year, it was necessary
to get our sledging parties on board as soon as
possible, in order to prepare the ship for sea, and to
commence the operations requisite for cutting her
out of winter quarters.</p>

<p>The snow on the hills to the northward of us was
rapidly disappearing; but this might only be due to
their southern aspect, for in our immediate vicinity
the snow appeared as deep as ever. Towards the
latter end of May the hills around the ship were
perfectly bare; but the heavy fall of snow, experienced
by us during our return journey, had again covered
them as they were during the winter.</p>

<p>Water began to form in little pools on the floes
near the ship, and every sign betokened the approaching
disruption of the pack. On the 23rd, a few king
ducks, some Arctic terns, and skuas were seen
hovering about the land, and one or two specimens
of the latter were shot&mdash;their skins swelling our
natural history collection, their bodies being reserved
for the sick.</p>

<p>On Sunday, June 25th, immediately after Divine
Service, on ascending Look-out-hill, to our very
great delight we observed the wanderers struggling
through the hummocks some six or seven miles off.
Hurrying down to communicate the good news, a
relief party was speedily formed, and by midnight
we had the very great satisfaction of receiving them
all on board. It was the old story repeated. All
were suffering from scurvy, and only Aldrich and
two men were able to walk alongside the ship, one
of the latter being so bad that he was under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>
medical treatment for many weeks after his return on
board.</p>

<p>Their absence from the ship extended over a period
of eighty-four days, during which they did very good
service, having explored no less than two hundred
and twenty miles of new coast line. May found them
near Cape Joseph Henry, not far from the spot
where he had before brought succour to my party.
They were then struggling bravely on, but were in a
very crippled condition. It is most fortunate he
succeeded in reaching them when he did. His cheery
spirit and strong help did much to assist them, and
enabled Aldrich to bring his little party alongside
their Arctic home in undiminished numbers. It was
a great relief to all on board to know that every one
had returned, that no stragglers were absent. So
great was the anxiety felt until all the sledging parties
had arrived, that the lot of those on board was hardly
more enviable than that of the travellers!</p>

<p>Our good ship was now converted into a regular
hospital, and might almost be said to be in charge
of the medical officers; for those who were not
actually under treatment had to be placed at the
disposal of the doctor, so as to act as nurses, cooks,
or attendants of some kind. Perfect rest and
careful nursing were the most essential requisites
for a complete restoration to health. Spenser
must have had the recovery of similar wayworn
and stricken travellers in his mind when he wrote&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Now when their wearie limbes with kindly reste</p>
<p class="i05">And bodies were refresht with dew repast.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>The medical staff were unremitting in their ceaseless
attention to their patients, and it was to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>
untiring watchfulness that we owed the complete
recovery of our sick.</p>

<p>Much had to be done to get the ship ready for
sea; but, for some time, only a few officers and <i>three</i>
men could be employed in any work connected with
these preparations, the remainder being engaged entirely
with their duties to the sick. The principal
work that had to be done, before the ice broke up
round the ship, was to get on board and stow away
all our powder, besides the provisions and stores that
had been landed before the winter. The housing had
long been taken down, and the upper deck had been
partially cleared of snow, so that daylight was once
more admitted through the skylights and illuminators.
It is a curious fact connected with those
who were for a long period absent from their ship,
that the hair on their faces became perfectly bleached,
until in fact it was nearly white. The loss of colour
was gradual, and, although noticed, was never alluded
to, each one imagining that his companion&rsquo;s hair
was turning grey from the effects of hardship and
anxiety! It was only after our return to the ship
that those possessing beards and moustaches discovered
the change that had occurred. The colour
returned in the same gradual manner that it had
disappeared. We all suffered a loss of hair from the
head; but this may easily be attributed to our sealskin
caps, and other head-dresses, which were constantly
worn.</p>

<p>After the long use of moccasins, it took us some
time to get accustomed to leather boots, which we
were obliged to wear on account of the sludgy state
of the surface of the floes and the land. With a
temperature some degrees below freezing point, nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>335</span>
is more comfortable or better suited for travelling
over the pack than a good pair of moccasins.</p>

<p>The return of the sledge travellers was celebrated,
on the 29th of June, by the best dinner we could
afford to put on the table. As our printing-press had
long been dismantled, a written <i>menu</i> was given to
myself and Aldrich as the leaders of the two extended
sledge parties. A beautiful sketch of the highest
position reached was drawn by Moss, the following
being as near as possible a fac-simile:&mdash;</p>

<p>Captain Nares had hinted that, in the present condition
of the men, and supposing also that those of the
&ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; were in the same state, he would not be
justified in allowing even one ship to remain another
year exposed to the rigours of an Arctic winter and to
the same causes that had led to the recent outbreak
of scurvy. We were prepared for this announcement;
for we well knew that to remain out a second winter,
although there were many of us ready and eager to
do so, would simply be to sacrifice many valuable
lives for no object; for we could not possibly expect
to reach a higher northern latitude, or even to extend
our explorations much farther to the westward,
although the whole force of the expedition should be
confined to the one direction. In deciding to return
to England, Captain Nares showed great moral
courage, and exercised a sound and wise judgment,
in the opinion of all his officers.</p>

<p>On the Sunday following the return of Aldrich&rsquo;s
party, a special thanksgiving was offered up to
Almighty God for our safe return, and prayers were
also said for the speedy recovery of our sick comrades.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July, on the usual monthly medical
examination being held, only ten men out of our fine
ship&rsquo;s company were reported in a fit state for work,
and some of these were convalescents! The invalids,
however, thanks to the doctor&rsquo;s assiduous care, were
improving slowly but surely.</p>

<p>The thaw had by this time commenced. The snow
was soft and wet in the valleys, small rivulets were
already meandering through the ravines and gorges,
whilst the summits of the mountains were covered
with brown patches that the wind and thaw combined
had left bare. Little tufts of the beautiful purple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
saxifrage dotted the sides of the hills over which we
walked, bringing forcibly to our minds the wild
flowers of our own dear country, and creating a longing
desire to behold them once more. Footprints
of animals, notably musk-oxen, were occasionally
observed; but although these traces appeared fresh,
they were evidently those of the preceding autumn,
which, having been covered with snow and frozen
hard during the winter, had thus been perfectly
preserved.</p>

<p>On the 5th of July, however, we were so fortunate
as to shoot three musk-oxen within three or four
miles of the ship, and on the following morning
another fell a victim to the prowess of our sportsmen.
This was indeed a God-send, for without fresh meat
the recovery of our sick would be long and tedious.
The actual amount of food obtained from these
animals was at the average rate of 120 lbs. from
each. The dexterity with which the beasts were
operated upon after death would have done credit to
the most accomplished butchers. Our first dish of
liver and bacon at breakfast was, it is needless to say,
done full justice to&mdash;the only fault being an insufficiency
in amount.</p>

<p>Fresh provisions were indispensable for the restoration
of the invalids to health. Shooting parties
were, therefore, organized amongst the officers, and
the whole country for a radius of many miles was
well scoured in search of game. These shooting
parties were very enjoyable, especially to those who,
like myself, had been engaged on one of the prolonged
sledging expeditions&mdash;the contrast being very great.
No anxiety, little or no responsibility, careless of
time, and oblivious of everything save our own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>339</span>
pleasure and convenience. Sleeping when we felt
tired, and having our meals when we felt hungry,
the night the same as the day, the sun at midnight
being as bright as at noon, free from all cares, intent
only on sport, the time passed in a serene and
delightful manner, and we were truly sorry when the
time came to relinquish our gipsying life for a more
civilized one on board.</p>

<p>On one of these shooting tours I was away from
the ship, accompanied by a few choice spirits, for
fourteen days. During that time we succeeded in
obtaining a couple of musk-oxen, and several brent
geese, which were a welcome addition to the fresh
meat already obtained for the sick on board the ship.
What delightful little meals we used to cook for ourselves,
each one taking his turn, and vying with the
others in his endeavours to make his dishes excel
those of his predecessor!</p>

<p>On one occasion we had for breakfast the livers and
gizzards of thirteen geese served up with a little
bacon, these being the perquisites of the sportsmen.
In the enjoyment of such luxuries it is not surprising
that a return to the ship, and our everlasting Australian
and New Zealand beef and mutton, was not
hailed with delight.</p>

<p>All this time the thaw had been rapidly progressing,
the tops of the hills were bare, and the ravines were
rendered almost impassable from the mountain torrents
that dashed down towards the sea, gaining
strength and volume as they neared their outlets.
These had to be crossed by the shooting parties, the
water reaching up to our waists, and flowing with
such force as nearly to carry us off our legs. As for
change of clothing, we had none; but on reaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
our tents we would get into our sleeping-bags and
leave our wet clothes outside to dry; the temperature
at this time being about 40°. A warm supper,
with a pannikin of hot tea, followed by a glass of
grog, soon made us forget the discomforts of the past
in the enjoyment of the present.</p>

<p>Some of the scenery, about five or ten miles in the
interior, was extremely picturesque. The spot that
we selected for our camp was on the borders of a lake
that formed one of a chain extending to the south
westward. Some of the hills surrounding these lakes
were beautifully carpeted with the pretty little purple
saxifrage, a <i>draba</i>, a <i>potentilla</i>, and other wild flowers,
while the valleys were covered with patches of luxuriant
vegetation, consisting of grasses and delightfully
soft moss. Altogether the aspect of the surrounding
country afforded a striking contrast to what it was
but a few short weeks back, when still wrapped in its
wintry garb.</p>

<p>On our return to the ship on the 24th of July, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>341</span>
were glad to hear that our invalids were progressing
favourably, and the convalescents regaining strength.
It was also a source of great gratification to us to find
a broad stream of water forming outside our protecting
floe-bergs, and extending from Point Sheridan
to as far south as we could see. This was a very
agreeable and unexpected surprise. Active preparations
were at once made to release the ship from her icy
prison. All stores and provisions were re-embarked,
instruments were brought on board and carefully
packed up and put away, boats were hoisted up, the
screw lowered, and the engines reported in good
working order. Strict orders were issued that no one
was to be absent from the ship, on any pretence, for a
longer period than four hours without express permission.
Any day might see our release! Anxious eyes
were constantly directed towards the pack, which was
now acted upon both by wind and tide, drifting north
and south as it felt their influences.</p>

<p>A large cairn, fully ten feet high, was erected on
the summit of &ldquo;Cairn Hill,&rdquo; in which was deposited
a record stating briefly what had been accomplished
by the expedition, and giving a list of the officers and
men of both ships. To this document each of the
former attached his signature. Will this ever be disturbed
by our fellow-men?</p>

<p>Strenuous exertions were made by means of powder
to blow up the ice between the ship and the channel
of water that almost tantalized us by its existence,
and so clear a passage by which we could effect our
escape. Countless torpedoes, containing from 1 to
50 lbs. of powder, were used to accomplish this object,
and many hours of hard labour were expended in the
same endeavour. At length, on the morning of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span>
31st of July, our exertions were crowned with success,
and great was the excitement on board when hurried
orders were issued to raise steam with all despatch
and to prepare for sea! A fresh south-westerly wind
had blown the pack off the shore, leaving a clear
channel of water extending as far as could be seen to
the southward.</p>

<p>By 7 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> the ship was free and afloat, and at eight
o&rsquo;clock the colours were hoisted, and we succeeded,
without much difficulty, in steaming clear of the
prison that had for eleven long months so securely
held us in its icy fetters.</p>

<p>Who can describe the feelings experienced by all on
board the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; on again hearing the long-silent
throbbing of the engines, and knowing that the ship
was once more in motion?</p>

<p>Yet a slight pang of regret was felt at leaving the
barren, sterile coast, off which we had passed so many
happy days, and we could not but feel grateful to the
kind floe-bergs which had, during that time, protected
us so well from &ldquo;ye merciless yce.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Cape Joseph Henry</span> was lost to sight as the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo;
rounded Cape Rawson; but very heavy ice off Cape
Union for a time completely obstructed our progress.</p>

<p>Excessive caution was necessary in handling the
ship amongst these ponderous floes. Patience combined
with perseverance are essential virtues inseparable
to successful ice navigation, and they were constantly
called into requisition in order to ensure a safe
deliverance from the dangers which surrounded us.</p>

<p>A vigilant look-out had to be kept on the pack, and
the ship was moved from time to time in order to
avoid a &ldquo;nip.&rdquo; Frequently we would observe a heavy
floe coming into contact with the large grounded
masses of ice that lined the coast, forcing them over,
or crumbling them into shapeless fragments, thus
clearly illustrating our own fate should we be so
unfortunate as to be caught between the two.</p>

<p>The orders &ldquo;up&rdquo; and &ldquo;down screw and rudder&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
were given and executed several times during each
day. As on our outward journey, preparations were
now made for abandoning the ship at a moment&rsquo;s
notice. Tents, clothing, cooking utensils, and all
necessaries for a life on shore were spread out on the
upper deck in readiness to be thrown on the ice in the
event of such a catastrophe.</p>

<p>The cool way in which we all spoke of the probable
loss of our home, and the prospect of being cast adrift
at a moment&rsquo;s notice, was very remarkable. Perhaps
the knowledge that our consort, the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; was
within some forty miles of us, and therefore within
easy travelling distance, might account for the light
manner in which such a calamity was regarded; but
it was impossible to disguise the fact that the loss of
our good ship would be a very serious, not to say
uncomfortable, event.</p>

<p>Steam had to be kept ready at a few minutes&rsquo;
notice, so as to take advantage of every little opening
that might occur in the ice, even though we should
only succeed in advancing a few hundred yards. On
one occasion the ship was purposely forced into the
pack, with which it drifted to the southward; but on
the turn of the tide, when the ice began to drift in the
opposite direction, it was no easy matter to free ourselves
from the bondage to which we had voluntarily
subjected ourselves. If it can be avoided, it is best
not to allow a ship to get beset, even when the drift of
the pack is favourable.</p>

<p>As we proceeded south, although our progress was
slow, the change in the appearance and massiveness
of the ice was very palpable. Occasionally we would
meet small specimens of our palæocrystic friends, over
which we had travelled during the preceding spring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>
but, as a rule, the ice was of a much lighter description.
Still the floes were far heavier than those met
with in Baffin Bay, and by no means to be despised.</p>

<p>During the time the ship was detained, waiting for
the ice to open to allow her to proceed, our sportsmen
were not idle, landing at all hours of the day and
night in order to procure fresh food for the sick. So
successful were they in their forays that the sick were
supplied with a fresh meat meal daily,&mdash;geese, ducks,
and hares forming the principal part of their &ldquo;bags.&rdquo;
The slaughter amongst the former was tremendous&mdash;entire
flocks numbering from fifty to seventy birds
falling victims to the prowess of not more than two
guns, and within the short space perhaps of half an
hour! The unfortunate birds being in the act of
moulting were, of course, unable to escape the unerring
aim of our marksmen.</p>

<p>In addition to crops of mustard and cress that we
succeeded in raising on board, we were able to obtain
small quantities of sorrel, which the convalescents
were sent on shore to gather from the valleys and
sides of the hills, often returning with sufficient to
enable a limited allowance to be served out periodically.
Sometimes the sick men were sent on shore
themselves to <i>browse</i> on this excellent antiscorbutic.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 5th of August, being within
twenty miles of the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; Egerton, accompanied
by one of the men, was sent to give them
information of our position. Our own ship was then,
and had been for the past forty-eight hours, effectually
jammed by the ice and unable to move. In the
mean time we on board the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; were endeavouring
to get our vessel clean, and into something like
order and ship-shape. On the following morning we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>346</span>
sustained a slight &ldquo;nip,&rdquo; caused by the ice setting
rapidly in towards us. Our rudder head was badly
wrenched before the rudder could be unshipped, and
the iron tiller was bent and crippled. We only succeeded
in easing the pressure by exploding some
charges under the ice. In the forenoon Rawson,
with two of the men belonging to the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo;
walked on board. We were, of course, delighted to
see them and to hear news of our consort.</p>

<p>From them we learnt that poor Egerton had lost
his way, and did not arrive on board their ship until
after he had been wandering about for eighteen
hours! The news from the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; was what
we feared. Notwithstanding the large amount of
musk-ox flesh procured by them during the autumn
and following summer, scurvy had attacked her crew
in almost the same virulent manner as it had ours.
The return journeys of some of their sledge parties
were simply a repetition of our own. Beaumont&rsquo;s
division&mdash;the one exploring the north-western coast of
Greenland&mdash;had suffered very severely, and we heard
with extreme regret that two of his small party had
succumbed to this terrible disease.</p>

<p>The rest of his men, with himself and Dr. Coppinger,
had not yet returned to the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo;
having remained in Polaris Bay to recruit their
healths. This was, indeed, a bitter ending to our
spring campaign, on which we had all set out so full
of enthusiasm and hope. It had the effect, however,
of confirming Captain Nares in his resolution to proceed
to England. With such broken-down crews it
would have been folly indeed to have risked the
rigours of a second Arctic winter; and there was
really nothing left for us to do, Beaumont having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>347</span>
done his work so well that it would have been impossible
for us to have extended any exploration in that
quarter. The &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; had been afloat for some
time, and was in perfect readiness to proceed to sea
on the arrival of Beaumont and his party. Their
absence caused us great anxiety, as the pack, being in
motion between ourselves and Polaris Bay, and consequently
where they would have to cross, made us
fully alive to the risks and dangers they would encounter
whilst crossing it. Still we hoped to hear of
their safe arrival as soon as we should drop anchor
alongside our consort in Discovery Bay.</p>

<p>The most important news was that a large seam of
lignite of the Miocene period had been discovered
within about three miles of their winter quarters.
They had not been able to utilize this coal, but several
large specimens had been carried to the ship&mdash;the
result of experiments made being that it was reported,
for steaming purposes, equal to the best Welsh
coal.</p>

<p>Whilst imprisoned by the ice and waiting to escape,
our naturalist made an interesting discovery within
two hundred yards of the ship. On the beach, about
twenty feet above high-water mark, he observed some
wood which, on examination, proved to be portions of
sledge runners and cross-pieces; also a snow scraper,
made from the tusk of a narwhal or walrus, and a
large lamp, apparently a piece of schistose rock
hollowed out.<a name="fa1t" id="fa1t" href="#ft1t"><span class="sp">1</span></a> These relics are the most northern
traces of Eskimos yet found. Their position would
lead one to suppose that the wanderers had arrived so
far north along the shores on the western side of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
channel, and from thence crossed over to the opposite
Greenland coast; the cliffs to the northward being
very steep, and although not actually impassable,
great difficulty would be experienced in travelling
along their base. This, and the absence of animal
life, would readily account for their desire to leave
such an inhospitable and sterile land.</p>

<p>On the 7th and 8th of August the ship was subjected
to some very severe squeezes. On the latter
day a large floe-berg pressed violently against the
vessel and forced her on shore, lifting the stern
bodily out of the water to a height of about five feet.
The noise of the cracking of the beams and the
groaning of the timbers was a sound that once heard
will never be forgotten. To those below, the crumbling
of the pitch in the deck seams sounded like a
shower of hail on the upper deck. Fortunately for
us the floe-berg was heavy and of deep flotation, and
therefore grounded before it had time to cause the
destruction of the ship. It was a grand sight to
witness some of the neighbouring floe-bergs&mdash;great
masses of ice from sixty to seventy feet in thickness&mdash;turned
completely over and swept away by the pack
in its irresistible career.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:889px; height:568px" src="images/img378.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">REDUCING A FLOE-BERG.</td></tr></table>

<p>We had no time, however, to indulge ourselves in
watching spectacles of such magnificence. Our position
was by no means pleasant: any pressure upon
the ship, caused by spring tides or otherwise, must
inevitably crush her; and the prospect of another
winter in the ice began to dawn upon us. There was
apparently no escape, as, from our experience of the
preceding year, we had cause to believe that, when
once the floe-bergs grounded along the coast, they
remained immoveable during the whole winter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
here were we forced on shore by a floe-berg which had
grounded immediately outside us. Our only chance
was to reduce the huge mass of ice by which we were
imprisoned, so as to lighten it sufficiently to float and
drift away at high water. It was a bold idea; but it
was no sooner resolved on than every available working
man in the ship, irrespective of rank or station,
was busily employed with axe, pick, or chisel in
demolishing the obstruction. On the third day, so
energetically was the work carried out, that the
judicious explosion of a heavy charge of powder immediately
under the berg had the effect of floating it
away at high water, and the ship was released.</p>

<p>The pack being loose, we succeeded in making good
progress, and on the following evening had the very
great satisfaction of anchoring alongside the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo;
after having been separated from her for
nearly twelve months. An interchange of visitors
immediately took place. Local news, for want of
more important intelligence, was fully and freely
discussed, and the routine of the winter and the doings
of the sledge parties formed topics of interesting
conversation. The prolonged absence of Beaumont
and his party acted as a damper upon our spirits,
for we could not hide from ourselves the fact that
their journey across the strait must be a hazardous
one. So uneasy did Captain Nares feel regarding
their safety that he determined upon going in search
of them, even over to Polaris Bay. Accordingly,
on Sunday morning, the 13th of August, having
transferred all our sick and helpless hands to the
&ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; and having our own ship&rsquo;s company
supplemented by six men from our consort, we again
made a start, but were stopped by heavy ice at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
entrance of the harbour, through which it was quite
impossible to penetrate. On the following day, to
our great delight, we observed a tent pitched on the
ice about three miles to the southward of the ship.
A relief party was quickly formed, and in a few hours
we had the extreme pleasure and satisfaction of
welcoming Beaumont and his party on board, none
the worse for what they had recently gone through, and
almost indignant at all offers of assistance that were
made to them. On account of the drifting of the pack
over which they had been travelling, their work, during
the last three or four days, had been excessively
severe. On occasions they were compelled to continue
the march for thirty-two and twenty-two consecutive
hours without resting.</p>

<p>As the ice still remained packed and impenetrable,
we were unable to advance, although more than one
unsuccessful attempt was made to push on. On
several occasions the dredge was hauled and with
good and interesting results. The coal seam was also
visited by different parties of officers. It exists in a
visible seam on the northern side of a ravine, and is
about three hundred yards long and twenty-five high.
We were unable to ascertain its depth below the
surface of the ground, or its thickness.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:895px; height:568px" src="images/img382.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">H.M.S. &ldquo;ALERT&rdquo; FORCED ON SHORE.</td></tr></table>

<p>We were also very fortunate in finding a large
number of vegetable fossils in the surrounding limestone,
some of the leaf impressions being very clear
and perfect. At the head of the ravine is a magnificent
cave, formed by the two sides of the gorge
and covered with a roof of frozen snow. This roof
is apparently permanent, as when we visited the
cave it was precisely in the same condition as when
it was first discovered twelve months before! The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span>
cave is very large, capable of accommodating easily
sixty or seventy men.</p>

<p>During these excursions several butterflies were
caught and brought on board as specimens, as also
some flies, gnats, and other <i>diptera</i>. Many hares
were also shot, to the great delight of our doctor, who
had been working like a horse in order to bring his
patients round.</p>

<p>The scenery in the channel between Bellot Island
and the mainland, through which we passed in one
of our vain attempts to get south, was very striking:
bold cliffs, and hills rising to a height of two thousand
feet on either side, intersected by deep ravines
and gorges having almost precipitous sides and terminating
in bays and little harbours.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 20th, by dint of boring and charging,
at the expense, however, of our rudder head, we
succeeded in forcing a passage through the ice in
Lady Franklin Bay, and into a broad stream of water
extending along the coast to the southward, which
we fondly hoped would eventually lead us into open
water.<a name="fa2t" id="fa2t" href="#ft2t"><span class="sp">2</span></a> But navigation in ice-bound seas is indeed
uncertain. For on the following day we were compelled
to seek refuge inside a land-locked and
apparently well-protected and secure harbour. How
deceitful was its appearance! Hardly an hour had
elapsed after entering this sheltered retreat, before
the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; was severely nipped by a heavy floe and
forced on shore.</p>

<p>For many hours the ship remained in a very critical
position, as the tide receding left her completely high
and dry, and listed over at an angle of 25°.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>352</span></p>

<p>So steep was the bank on which we had been
forced, that at low water we were able to walk,
&ldquo;dry shod,&rdquo; from the stem to the main chains, whilst
aft the water was over our mizzen chains, and within
a short distance of the taff-rail. A good sensational
photograph and some sketches were made of the ship
in this unpleasant position. Strenuous efforts were,
of course, at once made to lighten and float the vessel.
The fore part was entirely cleared, and the chain
cables brought aft. A bower anchor was laid out
astern in order to haul the ship off to.</p>

<p>The manner in which this latter work was performed
was both novel and ingenious. A small but heavy
piece of ice was secured and brought alongside the
ship. On this was placed the anchor, as on a raft.
It was then towed by boats to the position decided
upon, when the raft was destroyed by exploding a
charge of gunpowder immediately underneath it, the
anchor, of course, sinking to the bottom.</p>

<p>With such good will did all work, that we had the
joy and satisfaction of seeing our good ship afloat,
and ready to proceed, in about fifteen hours from the
time of the accident taking place. The bay, which
was the scene of our mishap, was called Rawlings
Bay, after one of our men, who was my sledge captain
in all my expeditions. A musk-ox skull and the horn
of a reindeer were picked up by Feilden close to where
the ship was aground, proving that the neighbourhood
is occasionally visited by these animals.</p>

<p>From this time, until the 9th of September, we
were engaged in a never-ceasing struggle with the
ice, frequently detained for many hours, and rarely
advancing more than a few hundred yards during
the day. The fast-forming ice reminded us unpleasantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>353</span>
of the near approach of winter, whilst
the land had again assumed its wintry covering of
snow. On the 22nd of August candles had to be
used below at midnight for reading or writing. The
young ice was found very tenacious, glueing and
cementing the broken fragments of floes together.
This caused such an impediment to our advance,
although the pack was what is termed loose, that
we were on several occasions compelled to relinquish
all attempts at penetrating farther, and to secure the
ships until a more favourable opportunity should
occur. Our stock of coal, too, was getting alarmingly
small, and had to be very carefully economized.
Without the means of steaming, our chance of escape
would, indeed, have been small.</p>

<p>On the 24th we rounded Cape Fraser;<a name="fa3t" id="fa3t" href="#ft3t"><span class="sp">3</span></a> on the
27th,<a name="fa4t" id="fa4t" href="#ft4t"><span class="sp">4</span></a> so slow was our progress, that we only just
succeeded in getting into Dobbin Bay, where we were
detained until the 3rd of September. The temperature
had fallen to 19°. Last year we were frozen
up on the 3rd of September, and here were we on the
same date with as low a temperature and many
miles to accomplish before we could actually be clear
of the ice!</p>

<p>Snow also began to fall heavily, and everything
appeared gloomy and inhospitable. As there was
now a prospect of our being forcibly detained for
another winter in the ice, and as some of our provisions
were getting low, on passing the large depôt
established in Dobbin Bay on our way up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>
previous year, we landed and brought off all the tea,
sugar, and chocolate, and such other articles as we
were likely to require.</p>

<p>Whilst this work was in progress, a large ground
seal (<i>Phoca barbata</i>) was shot by Hans, of the
&ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; on which was found a partially healed
wound; on further examination, an iron-pointed harpoon
with an ivory socket, evidently of Eskimo construction,
was discovered imbedded in its blubber.
It would have been very interesting if we could have
traced, by the manufacture of the instrument, the
tribe to which it had belonged and the locality where
the wound was inflicted.</p>

<p>One morning, when some little distance from the
land, a small fox, of a mottled colour, wandered off
to the ship, being attracted towards us either by
hunger or curiosity. The officer of the watch, always
on the <i>alert</i>, soon spied the little animal cruising
about amongst the hummocks and shot it. The skin
was preserved with the collection of natural history
specimens, whilst the body was eaten by us at dinner
and found to be delicious. Passing Cape Hawks,
and Allman Bay, an inlet which was named after the
distinguished President of the Linnæan Society, we
continued to push the ships in the direction of open
water to the south, which we at length reached.</p>

<p>It was with no small amount of thankfulness that
on the 9th of September we emerged from the cold,
grim clutches that seemed only too ready to detain
us for another winter in the realms of the Ice King,
and that we felt our ship rise and fall once more on
the bosom of an undoubted ocean swell. It was,
indeed, a joyous sensation to look around and see
nothing but blue water, and, with the exception of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>355</span>
few straggling bergs, not a single speck of ice in
sight. This broad sheet of water had for some time
been known to us, having been observed from the
summits of various hills that we had ascended, and
all our energies of late had been concentrated into
reaching it. We had a hard fight, but perseverance
and patience ultimately proved triumphant.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">ALLMAN BAY.</td></tr></table>

<p>On first reaching it, we found it to be coated with
a thin layer of young ice, which offered a great deal
of hindrance, although it had not the effect of
checking us altogether. Our course through this
young ice could be distinctly traced for a long distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span>
astern, by a broad lane of water resembling the
Suez Canal. At 6 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> we passed Cape Sabine, and
distinguished our cairn on the top of Brevoort Island
apparently untouched. Ahead was Cape Isabella,
towards which we steered.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Shortly</span> before midnight, on the 9th of September,
Cape Isabella was reached and the ships were clear
of Smith Sound. As, on our outward journey, to me
had been allotted the duty of erecting a cairn on that
prominent headland, and establishing a post office,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>358</span>
so, on our return journey, was I assigned the duty of
visiting the place in order to ascertain if letters had
been deposited there during the period of our absence
by any enterprising friend. On reaching the lower
cairn, to my great surprise&mdash;for we hardly expected
that any one would have visited the place since our
departure the previous year&mdash;I found an additional
cask had been placed alongside the one that I had
established there. This was quickly opened, and
found to contain a small mail for each ship.</p>

<p>Hurriedly leaving a record notifying our visit, we
eagerly seized our treasures and made the best of our
way to the boat. Great was the excitement when the
news spread that a mail from England was actually on
board, and we were soon deep in the enjoyment of
perusing late letters from home, a pleasure to which
we had so long been strangers.</p>

<p>Many were the heartfelt expressions of gratitude
that rose to the lips of those lucky recipients of home
news towards that gallant officer and friend who had
so perseveringly and so generously, in spite of many
dangers and difficulties, succeeded in depositing their
letters so far north. The bulk of our mail we imagined
had been left either at Disco or Upernivik.
Had we examined the cairn on the summit of Cape
Isabella, we should there have learnt that the same
kind and disinterested friend had taken them to
Littleton Island, and there safely deposited them.
Being ignorant of this fact, and the weather being
against our proceeding thither, a course was shaped
to the southward; those who were under the impression
that our English letters were really on that
island being consoled by the fact that we were steering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>359</span>
homewards, and that in a short time letters would
be no longer necessary or of any value.</p>

<p>Wars, and rumours of wars, were prevalent, for
our latest news came from England at the time when
all Europe was disturbed and unsettled by the complexion
of affairs in the East.</p>

<p>This made us all the more anxious to get home
quickly; but alas! everything was against us. Tempestuous
weather, with the wind <i>always</i> contrary, was
our introduction to our own element, and, as our coal
was running very short, we were obliged to put the
ships under canvas and thrash them at it. Icebergs
were innumerable, and, as the nights were increasing
in length and the darkness in density, they were anything
but pleasant neighbours.</p>

<p>On the 12th of September it was blowing so hard
and the weather was so thick, that it was determined
to seek an anchorage under the lee of the land in
Whale Sound, and there wait until the weather
moderated. With this object the ships were worked
up under fore and aft sails and steam, eventually
anchoring in a small bay (Bardin Bay) in close proximity
to the Tyndall Glacier. As we came in we
observed an Eskimo settlement on the eastern side
of the bay, and several natives were seen running
along the land towards us; but as the glacier intervened
they were unable to communicate, and the
weather was too bad to allow us to send a boat to
them. This was much to be deplored, as, irrespective
of the fact that these people were the first human
beings that we had seen for many a long month, it
was desirable that we should propitiate them in favour
of white men, and for this purpose we had many little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>360</span>
articles of infinite value to them, such as knives,
needles, thread, scissors, etc., besides provisions,
ready for their acceptance.</p>

<p>These natives were of the same tribe as those
who were so kind to Kane and Hayes, and also to the
&ldquo;Polaris,&rdquo; so it would have been a good action, independently
of all other reasons, could we have befriended
them.</p>

<p>We had not been at anchor, however, more than
five hours before a change of wind, accompanied by
heavy squalls which came over the hills fast and
furious, obliged us to get under weigh, and again put
to sea, although the weather was as thick and the
wind as strong as ever&mdash;added to which hail and snow
showers were frequent: altogether a very unpleasant
and miserable night was spent, for it was nearly
midnight when we were forced to fly from our
harbour.</p>

<p>On the 16th we were beating about off the entrance
to Lancaster Sound, near Cape Byam Martin. This
was all familiar ground to me, and brought back
to my recollection scenes on board the old whaler,
&ldquo;Arctic,&rdquo; that had occurred in the same locality
three years before. We made many tacks in our
endeavours to weather Cape Walter Bathurst, but, for
a long time, without success, for the wind invariably
headed us on each tack.</p>

<p>On the 20th several eider-ducks, some turnstones,
rotges, and snow-buntings were seen, but all going
in a southerly direction, apparently anxious to seek
warmer climes before the winter should have claimed
both the sea and land. How we envied these birds
their means of locomotion! for foul and strong winds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>361</span>
causing slow progress, were beginning to be very
irksome. Our old friends the &ldquo;mollies&rdquo; (fulmar
petrels), that we had not seen for so long, again
joined us, and might be seen continually darting
down and picking up in their voracious maws all
scraps that had been thrown overboard.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">FULMAR PETRELS (&ldquo;MOLLIES&rdquo;).</td></tr></table>

<p>The persistent manner in which the bad weather
clung to us was quite marvellous. Hardly a fine day
had been enjoyed since we emerged from the ice. The
words of Falconer would have been applicable to us,
and might have been repeated with truth every morning:</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p class="i05">It comes resistless! and with foaming sweep,</p>
<p class="i05">Upturns the whitening surface of the deep.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>At length, after being buffeted about for many
days, the high land of Disco was sighted on the 25th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>362</span>
of September; and on the same day we came to an
anchor in the little harbour of Godhavn, and congratulated
ourselves once more upon our return to
civilization.</p>

<p>The day, as if to make up for our previous bad
weather, was a bright sunny one, and perfectly still
and calm. This was all the more appreciated after
the turbulent seas which had lately almost driven us
distracted. The scenery coming in was very beautiful.
On one side were the high cliffs of Disco,
intersected here and there with deep fiords and bays,
whilst on the other lay the perfectly quiescent sea,
studded with icebergs of all shapes and sizes. Occasionally
the surface of the water would be ruffled
and disturbed by the appearance of a seal&rsquo;s head, as
the inquisitive little animal would pop it up to gaze
curiously at us as we steamed slowly by; or else a
whale, as he swam lazily along, would give a flick
with his huge tail, or spout a jet of water in the air,
which might be taken either as a welcome back to
more genial climes, or an angry remonstrance that a
monster larger than himself should dare to live in
his own particular domain. Birds flew around and
alighted near us. One, a ger-falcon, was so bold as to
venture to perch upon our fore-royal truck; but, I am
ashamed to relate, was fired at for its misplaced
confidence. It escaped, however, unhurt. Everything
was bright and joyous, and all were happy and elated.
Our joy was slightly marred on arrival to find that
our mails had really been taken on and left at
Littleton Island; but a mail, with letters of a later
date than those brought out by the &ldquo;Pandora,&rdquo;
which had been got together and made up for us at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>363</span>
Copenhagen by my cousin, had just arrived in the
Danish brig &ldquo;Tjalfe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course it could not be expected that, during the
period of our absence from England, no sad changes
should have taken place, and the sorrowful faces of
more than one among us testified to the fact that
some dear and loved ones would be seen no more in
this world.</p>

<p>From Mr. Krarup Smith, the Inspector, we learnt
that the &ldquo;Pandora&rdquo; had only taken her departure
for England four days previously, having been unsuccessful
in her endeavours to reach Cape Sabine.
The attempt had only been relinquished by her commander
when the lateness of the season compelled
him to beat a retreat. A supply of beer, sent from
England by my cousin, was found awaiting our
arrival, and was most acceptable. A cask of beer
had also been kindly left for our use by Allen Young,
so that we were enabled to supply &ldquo;all hands&rdquo; with
a glass of beer twice a week during the passage
to England. Through the kindness of the Danish
authorities, we were able to obtain thirty tons of coal,
with a promise of thirty more if we chose to go
to Egedesminde, another settlement about sixty miles
to the southward. This was an offer too valuable
to be disregarded, and was accepted by Captain
Nares.</p>

<p>Having shifted our rudder, which, to use an
American phrase, was &ldquo;pretty considerably chawed
up,&rdquo; from its treatment by the ice, and made good a
few other defects, we took our departure from Godhavn
on the morning of the 28th, Mr. Krarup Smith,
the Inspector, coming on board to accompany us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>364</span>
round to Egedesminde. As we steamed out of harbour
the little three-gun battery fired a farewell
salute, the ensigns on shore, and on board, were
dipped, and the ladies (two in number), from their
verandahs, waved with their pocket handkerchiefs a
last adieu. It was a fine clear morning as we left; but
a thick fog soon overtook us, in which we remained
enveloped for the remainder of the day, and it was
not until the following morning that we reached our
destination.</p>

<p>Our way took us through a perfect labyrinth of
small islands, some of the narrow channels through
which we had to pass being almost blocked by large
grounded masses of ice, remnants of icebergs. The
&ldquo;Alert&rdquo; and &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; being the first steamers
that had ever visited Egedesminde, the natives turned
out in force to witness our arrival. Several kayaks
came skimming rapidly along the smooth and unruffled
surface of the water as we approached, their
occupants gazing with evident astonishment at the
large &ldquo;umiaks,&rdquo; whose motive power was to them
invisible and incomprehensible. The Danish flag
was run up on three separate flag-staves on shore,
and a salute of seven guns was fired to welcome our
arrival.</p>

<p>There is much similarity about the various Danish
settlements in Greenland. The houses are of the
same size and colour, and generally of about the
same number, whilst all possess their little church,
their storehouse, and their cooperage. The settlement
is very prettily situated on the northern side of
the largest of a group of many islands of all sizes.
These are of the same metamorphic formation, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>365</span>
possess a more luxuriant vegetation than we had
hitherto seen. The island is covered with numerous
small lakes and ponds, and is extremely marshy and
swampy. The difficulty of walking, without sinking
up to the ankles in a bog, is very great.</p>

<p>The population of Egedesminde, which is the most
southern settlement in the Inspectorate of North
Greenland, is about one hundred and thirty souls,
including the Danes, who with the Governor and his
family number about twelve. The entire population
of North Greenland is about four thousand three
hundred.</p>

<p>The boggy substance, like peat, is dug up and
stacked during the summer, and when dried is very
generally used as fuel. The chief employment of the
inhabitants is, as at the other settlements, that of
collecting skins and blubber. Reindeer are obtained
on the mainland, but they are not plentiful.</p>

<p>The Governor, Mr. Boldroe, was good enough to
present us with a fine large haunch of venison; but,
curious to relate, when served up, it had an unmistakeable
taste and odour of musk! Our scorbutic
patients, who were at this time nearly all convalescent,
benefited largely from the quantities of fresh
fish, principally cod, obtainable at this place.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 2nd of October, having
received on board the amount of coal promised, we
bade our kind friends farewell, and steamed away
amidst the usual firing of guns and dipping of
colours. The stoppages at these two civilized places
were very pleasant breaks to us, after our long absence
from society of any description, except our own,
and were not regretted by any one. Indeed, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>
kindness and true hospitality extended to us by our
Danish friends in the different settlements in Northern
Greenland will long be remembered with feelings of
gratitude and pleasure.</p>

<p>From the date of leaving this our last port until
our arrival at Valentia, we experienced very tempestuous
weather. Strong head winds were in constant
attendance, and the ship&rsquo;s general state was being
&ldquo;battened down and under close-reefed topsails.&rdquo;
Under these circumstances our daily rate of progress
was remarkably slow, and on some days we found
that we had actually increased our distance from
home instead of having lessened it. Few on board
had before experienced a longer continuance of really
stormy weather. From the severe buffeting we
received, our rudder, already crippled, was reduced to
such a state as to be absolutely useless, the rudder-head
being almost wrenched off, and we were obliged
to steer the ship during the remainder of the voyage
by means of the rudder pendants.</p>

<p>On the 16th of October, to the intense surprise of
everybody, a vessel was sighted ahead, which proved
to be the &ldquo;Pandora.&rdquo; How very small is this world we
live in! Here were we in the middle of the broad
Atlantic, fifteen hundred miles from England, and
out of the course of all ships, and yet actually
meeting a vessel that had purposely come out to
seek us.</p>

<p>The weather was too bad to allow us to communicate,
but an interchange of news was effected by
signal. The three ships remained in company for a
couple of days, when they lost sight of each other
in thick and blowy weather, we having previously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span>
ordered the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; to rendezvous at Queenstown
in case of parting company.</p>

<p>Our rudder being in such a dilapidated state,
Captain Nares determined upon putting in to Valentia
for the purpose of shifting it, the spare one
having in the mean time been temporarily repaired.
With this object we anchored in the snug little harbour
of Valentia, on the 27th of October, and here
Captain Nares and several of the officers left for the
purpose of proceeding at once to London to report our
arrival.</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>It is in vain to attempt to describe the pleasure we
all felt at beholding trees and green fields once more,
with the cattle browsing in them. It is difficult at
once to throw off old habits, and there were many on
board who expressed their anxiety to land at once
with their guns for the purpose of shooting &ldquo;that
herd of musk-oxen.&rdquo; Had we given way to our inclinations,
I fear our reception would not have been
so warm or so hospitable as it was.</p>

<p>The people of Valentia were the first to bid us
welcome. Their kindness and hospitality will never
be effaced from our memory. The rudder having been
shifted, and sundry repairs executed, we took our
departure on the following morning at daylight, being
guided out of the place by a most eccentric and original
old pilot. On the 29th we reached Queenstown,
where we found the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; had arrived only a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
couple of hours before. Here again we received a
warm welcome and enjoyed that hearty hospitality
for which the Irish people are so justly celebrated.
That evening we were the guests of the Port Admiral,
he and Mrs. Hillyar hearing of no refusal, although
we had to sit down to dinner in&mdash;well, clothes very
dirty and very much the worse for wear. The next
day, having taken in a supply of coals, we started for
Portsmouth, the two ships remaining in company
and arriving in that harbour together on the 2nd of
November.</p>

<p>Our reception there and afterwards is a matter of
history. Suffice it to say that our exertions received
the approbation of our country and of our brother
officers, and that the Lords of the Admiralty were
pleased to express their satisfaction at the manner
in which the expedition had been conducted by our
leader, as well as at the way in which the work had
been carried out by his subordinates.</p>

<p>My story has now come to an end. My aim has
been to describe our daily life during a very eventful
service.</p>

<p>I have quoted largely from my journal, and in
some instances I have thought it best to copy from
it <i>verbatim</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing is further from my thoughts than to claim
for this narrative any literary merit whatever. I
simply wish it to be regarded as a plain but accurate
statement of facts&mdash;an unpretending account of the
cruise of one of the ships of the late expedition&mdash;by
one of its members.</p>

<p>In launching my little book upon the ocean of
literature, I venture to quote the words of brave old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>369</span>
Master Beste, who, being engaged in compiling a
record of another Arctic expedition, humbly apologizes,
as I do, for submitting his work to the public:&mdash;&ldquo;And
herein I humbly pray pardon, for my rude
order of writing, which proceedeth from the barren
brayne of a souldier and one professing armes, who
desireth rather to be wel thought of with your honour
for his well meaning than for anye hys cunning
writing at all.&rdquo;</p>
